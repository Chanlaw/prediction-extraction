923325943,yes,1,"Meanwhile, I think that Trump would be a very weak general election candidate — the conditions that have let him flourish in the GOP are really unique to that party."
923326032,yes,1,"If the US institutes a 15 dollar minimum wage, the economy will do worse than if we instituted a negative income tax. "
923326031,yes,1,"It is likely that if Rubio becomes the Republican Nominee, then the Democrats will win the general election."
923325938,yes,0.5,Then the comparison is between the expected awfulness to come if the GOP chooses Trump versus choosing non-Trump.
923326030,yes,1,Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic Nominee
923325941,yes,0.5,"As you can see, the downside of a Trump nomination is his extra awfulness multiplied by his chance of winning; the downside of Non-Trump is his own awfulness, multiplied by the extra chance of a GOP victory."
923326024,yes,0.75,"She (yes, it’s still overwhelmingly likely to be Hillary Clinton) will, rightly, express skepticism about future trade deals, but she will be able to address the problems of working families without engaging in irresponsible trash talk about the world trade system. "
923325964,yes,0.7625,"Protectionism can do real harm, making economies less efficient and reducing long-run growth."
923325944,yes,0.75,So I think that progressives should be cheering Trump on (which is why my secret committee has been orchestrating that conspiracy Cruz talks about.)
923326019,yes,0.5263,"If U.S. corporations were able to use the threat of imports to smash unions, it was only because our political environment supported union-busting. "
923326010,yes,1,"Then again, we might be talking about President Trump."
923326007,yes,0.75,"There’s also the collateral damage such a turn would inflict on poor countries. "
923326002,yes,0.5,"Actually, the latter episode should be an object lesson for anyone talking tough about trade. "
923325994,yes,0.7368,"What’s more, the positions of the parties will be the reverse of what you might have expected: Republicans, who claim to stand for free markets, are likely to nominate a crude protectionist, leaving Democrats, with their skepticism about untrammeled markets, as the de facto defenders of relatively open trade."
923325992,yes,1,Bernie Sanders Will Make the Economy Great Again
923325991,yes,0.7271,"After the Super Tuesday primaries, Donald Trump will have the most pledged delegates."
923325956,yes,0.7692,In his stop-Trump speech last week he warned that if The Donald became president America would “sink into prolonged recession.”
923325932,no,1,Should progressives fear a Trump nomination or cheer it on?
923325955,no,1,"Mr. Romney claims to be aghast. "
923325954,no,0.7436,His solution is “countervailing duties” — basically tariffs — similar to those we routinely impose when foreign countries are found to be subsidizing exports in violation of trade agreements.
923325957,no,0.7895,"Why? The only specific reason he gave was that those duties would “instigate a trade war and that would raise prices for consumers, kill our export jobs and lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all stripes to flee America.”"
923325958,no,1,This is pretty funny if you remember anything about the 2012 campaign.
923325959,no,1,"Back then, in accepting Mr. Trump’s endorsement, Mr. Romney praised the businessman (who was already a well-known “birther”) as someone with an “extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works.”"
923325960,no,1,"But wait, it gets better: at the time, Mr. Romney was saying almost exactly the same things Mr. Trump is saying now. "
923325961,no,1,"He promised to — you guessed it — declare China a currency manipulator, while attacking President Obama for failing to do so."
923325962,no,1,"And he brushed off concerns about starting a trade war, declaring that one was already underway: “It’s a silent one, and they’re winning.”"
923325963,no,1,"More important than Mr. Romney’s awkward history here, however, is the fact that his economic analysis is all wrong."
923325953,no,1,"This manipulation, he says, is “robbing Americans of billions of dollars of capital and millions of jobs.”"
923325965,no,1,But it doesn’t cause recessions.
923325966,no,1,Why not?
923325967,no,1,Doesn’t a trade war reduce employment in export industries?
923325968,no,1,"Yes, and it also increases employment in industries that compete with imports."
923325969,no,1,"In fact, a worldwide trade war would, by definition, reduce imports by exactly the same amount that it reduces exports. "
923325970,no,0.7368,There’s no reason to assume that the net effect on employment would be strongly negative.
923325971,no,1,But didn’t protectionism cause the Great Depression?
923325972,no,1,"No, it didn’t — protectionism was a result of the Depression, not its cause."
923325973,no,0.7692,"By the way, if you want an example of a policy that really did have a lot to do with the Great Depression’s spread, that would be the gold standard — which Ted Cruz wants to restore."
923325974,no,1,So Mr. Romney is talking nonsense.
923325975,no,1,But so is Mr. Trump.
923325976,no,1,"Five years ago the Trump complaint that Chinese currency manipulation was costing U.S. jobs had some validity — in fact, serious economists were making the same point. "
923325977,no,1,"But these days China is in big trouble, and is trying to keep the value of its currency up, not down: foreign exchange reserves are plunging in the face of huge capital flight, to the tune of a trillion dollars over the past year."
923325978,no,1,"Nor is China alone. "
923325979,no,1,"All around the world, capital is fleeing troubled economies — including, by the way, the euro area, which these days tends to run bigger trade surpluses than China. "
923325980,no,1,"And much of that flight capital is heading for the United States, pushing up the dollar and making our industries less competitive."
923325981,no,1,"It’s a real problem; U.S. economic fundamentals are fairly strong, but we risk, in effect, importing economic weakness from the rest of the world."
923325982,no,0.7436,But it’s not a problem we can address by lashing out at foreigners we falsely imagine are winning at our expense.
923325983,no,1,"What can we do to fight imported economic weakness? "
923325984,no,1,"That’s a big subject, but one thing is for sure: given the pressures from abroad, and the worrying strength of the dollar, the Federal Reserve really, really needs to hold off on raising interest rates."
923325985,no,0.7368,"Did I mention that Mr. Trump wants to see rates rise? "
923325952,no,1,"Attacks on immigrants are still the central theme of the Republican front-runner’s campaign, but he has opened a second front on trade deficits, which he asserts are being caused by the currency manipulation of other countries, especially China."
923325987,no,1,So there you have it.
923325988,no,1,The good news is that there was a real policy debate going on within the G.O.P. last week.
923325989,no,1,The bad news is that it was junk economics on both sides.
923325990,no,0.5263,The risks tilt heavility toward inflation rates below official targets.
923325951,no,1,The starting point for this debate is Mr. Trump’s deviation from free-market orthodoxy on international trade.
923325950,no,1,"Unfortunately, both men are talking nonsense. Are you surprised?"
923325993,no,0.5263,"There are a lot of things about the 2016 election that nobody saw coming, and one of them is that international trade policy is likely to be a major issue in the presidential campaign. "
923325949,no,1,"Yet last week, offstage, there was in effect a real debate about economic policy between Donald Trump and Mitt Romney, who is trying to block his nomination."
923325995,no,1,"But this isn’t as peculiar a development as it seems. "
923325996,no,0.7368,"Rhetorical claims aside, Republicans have long tended in practice to be more protectionist than Democrats."
923325997,no,1,And there’s a reason for that difference.
923325998,no,1,"It’s true that globalization puts downward pressure on the wages of many workers — but progressives can offer a variety of responses to that pressure, whereas on the right, protectionism is all they’ve got."
923325999,no,1,"When I say that Republicans have been more protectionist than Democrats, I’m not talking about the distant past, about the high-tariff policies of the Gilded Age; I’m talking about modern Republican presidents, like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush."
923326000,no,1,"Reagan, after all, imposed an import quota on automobiles that ended up costing consumers billions of dollars."
923326001,no,0.75,"And Mr. Bush imposed tariffs on steel that were in clear violation of international agreements, only to back down after the European Union threatened to impose retaliatory sanctions."
923325948,no,1,"Even the most hardened cynics couldn’t have imagined that the candidates would sink so low, and stay so focused on personal insults."
923326003,no,1,"The Bush administration suffered from a bad case of superpower delusion, a belief that America could dictate events throughout the world. "
923326004,no,1,The falseness of that belief was most spectacularly demonstrated by the debacle in Iraq.
923326005,no,1,"But the reckoning came even sooner on trade, an area where other players, Europe in particular, have just as much power as we do."
923326006,no,1,Nor is the threat of retaliation the only factor that should deter any hard protectionist turn.
923325947,no,1,The formal debates among the Republicans who would be president have exceeded all expectations.
923326008,no,0.7271,"It’s probably bad politics to talk right now about what a trade war would do to, say, Bangladesh."
923326009,no,0.75,But any responsible future president would have to think hard about such matters.
923325946,no,1,"And that was a good way to waste a bit of time, wasn’t it?"
923326011,no,1,But back to the broader issue of how to help workers pressured by the global economy.
923326012,no,0.5137,"Serious economic analysis has never supported the Panglossian view of trade as win-win for everyone that is popular in elite circles: growing trade can indeed hurt many people, and for the past few decades globalization has probably been, on net, a depressing force for the majority of U.S. workers."
923326013,no,1,"But protectionism isn’t the only way to fight that downward pressure. "
923326014,no,1,"In fact, many of the bad things we associate with globalization in America were political choices, not necessary consequences — and they didn’t happen in other advanced countries, even though those countries faced the same global forces we did."
923326015,no,1,"Consider, for example, the case of Denmark, which Bernie Sanders famously held up as a role model."
923326016,no,1,"As a member of the European Union, Denmark is subject to the same global trade agreements as we are — and while it doesn’t have a free-trade agreement with Mexico, there are plenty of low-wage workers in eastern and southern Europe. "
923326017,no,1,Yet Denmark has much lower inequality than we do. Why?
923326018,no,1,"Part of the answer is that workers in Denmark, two-thirds of whom are unionized, still have a lot of bargaining power."
923325945,no,0.7574,But you may differ.
923326020,no,0.75,"Even Canada, right next door, has seen nothing like the union collapse that took place here."
923326021,no,1,"And the rest of the answer is that Denmark (and, to a lesser extent, Canada) has a much stronger social safety net than we do. "
923326022,no,1,"In America, we’re constantly told that global competition means that we can’t even afford even the safety net we have; strange to say, other rich countries don’t seem to have that problem."
923326023,no,0.7436,"What all this means, as I said, is that the Democratic nominee won’t have to engage in saber-rattling over trade. "
923325942,no,1,"My sense is that Trump is awful, but not that much more awful than the others — Rubio, for example, is among other things the candidate of the people who brought you Iraq and want to do it all over again."
923326025,no,0.75,The Republican nominee won’t.
923326026,no,1,"And there’s a lesson here that goes beyond this election. "
923326027,no,1,"If you’re generally a supporter of open world markets — which you should be, mainly because market access is so important to poor countries — you need to know that whatever they may say, politicians who espouse rigid free-market ideology are not on your side."
923325940,no,1,"n each case, the expected awfulness is the product of the probability of election versus the awfulness if elected, i.e., the area of a rectangle whose base is the probability and whose height is the awfulness:"
923325939,no,1,"In the figure, I use orange to represent Trump (I tried to replicate the spray tan, but this was as close as I could get), and red to represent non-Trump."
923325937,no,0.5263,(This worked better before Marco Rubio’s implosion; Cruz may be just as awful and just as bad a candidate as Trump.)
923325936,no,1,"So let’s think of the choice being between Trump and Not-Trump, who is somewhat less awful but more likely to win in the general."
923325935,no,1,"Still, it’s something people think about, and I found myself trying to clarify things with a silly diagram."
923325934,no,1,"While Ted Cruz may insist that the liberal media are conspiring to choose Trump so they can blow him up later — it’s all tinfoil hats over there, folks — the truth is that Republican primary voters don’t watch John Oliver, and an endorsement from the NY Times is probably the kiss of death."
923325933,no,1,"The basic answer is, of course, who cares?"
923325986,no,1,"Not only that, but he’s a full-on conspiracy theorist, declaring that Janet Yellen, the Fed’s chairperson, is keeping interest rates down as a favor to President Obama, who “wants to be out playing golf a year from now.”"
