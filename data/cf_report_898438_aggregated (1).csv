937053524,yes,0.6863,"Also, my worries are that China doesn’t know how to slow down — that it’s a bicycle economy that falls over if it stops moving forward."
937052697,yes,0.665,"First, it’s much, much harder to get actual deflation than simply to have stable prices, so scenario A means much higher unemployment."
937054570,yes,0.6705,"Cut off that support, and Greece suffers banking collapse."
937053265,yes,0.6496,"Romney: I want to make sure the Federal Reserve focuses on maintaining the monetary stability that leads to a strong dollar and confidence that America is not going to go down the road that other nations have gone down, to their peril."
937057065,yes,0.6592,"Basically, we’ve had multiple years of very low rates, with no hint of a runaway boom or an inflationary takeoff, so any reasonable estimate is going to say that these low, low rates are close to (and maybe above) the natural rate."
937052918,yes,1,"My sense is that a lot of what’s going on in our ongoing policy disaster is that important people, up to and including the president, just find it implausible that such a big crisis could be essentially a problem of coordination, that it’s just magneto trouble whose fix need not, in fact should not, involve inflicting a lot of punishment on working Americans."
937053945,yes,1,"The anti-Keynesian proposition is that government spending to boost a depressed economy will fail, because it will lead to an equal or greater fall in private spending — it will crowd out investment and maybe consumption, and therefore accomplish nothing except a shift in who spends."
937052806,yes,0.6504,"Update: Also, if you think that US interest rates are being held down by the fact that in some sense the Treasury hasn’t had to go to the market lately, since the Fed is buying debt — although the Fed isn’t actually buying it direct from Treasury — consider the case of Greeece."
937052672,yes,1,"And once you add in debt-constrained players, it’s likely that the effect actually goes the other way: a fall in wages worsens debt problems, and so ends up contractionary."
937056286,yes,0.6693,"Now, Brad argues that we’re going to need even more of this kind of paternalism."
937056591,yes,0.6763,"Then again, that’s probably why they will never, ever listen to what I have to say."
937057361,yes,0.6841,"In fact, a worldwide trade war would, by definition, reduce imports by exactly the same amount that it reduces exports. "
937057028,yes,1,"Again, not the thing most people will remember about Romney’s speech."
937056167,yes,0.6756,"The moral of the Japanese example is that if other countries are managing to achieve a moderately positive rate of inflation, but you have let yourself slip into deflation or even into “lowflation”, you can indeed manage to find yourself in secular stagnation even if the rest of the world offers positive-return investment opportunities."
937054049,yes,1,"IS-LM said not, but I was sure that if you really worked it through carefully you could show that, say, doubling the monetary base will always raise prices, even if you’re at the zero lower bound."
937057386,yes,1,"There are a lot of things about the 2016 election that nobody saw coming, and one of them is that international trade policy is likely to be a major issue in the presidential campaign. "
937057417,yes,0.6731,"She (yes, it’s still overwhelmingly likely to be Hillary Clinton) will, rightly, express skepticism about future trade deals, but she will be able to address the problems of working families without engaging in irresponsible trash talk about the world trade system. "
937054448,yes,1,"OK, this is not going to happen — even in the best of circumstances, Syriza is going to be able to get a relaxation of the primary surplus requirement, not complete abrogation."
937056996,yes,0.677,"But of course they’re wrong: if Sanders is the nominee, it will take around 30 seconds before Fox News is nonstop coverage of the terrible things he supposedly did when younger."
937052123,yes,0.6597,"Since GDP is roughly $15 trillion, this means that you have to raise GDP by $300 billion per year to reduce unemployment by 1 percentage point."
937056891,yes,1,"The next thing you know, they’ll be bringing back the architects of the Iraq disaster to do it all over again."
937052076,yes,0.6344,I can see the case for arguing that it will be nasty.
937056170,yes,0.6746,"However, he argues that the large current account surplus of the euro area as a whole is a temporary phenomenon driven by cyclical weakness in the euro periphery, and therefore not likely to be a source of persistent trouble."
937056505,yes,0.694,"A weaker economy will mean lower inflation (or faster deflation), which also tends to raise the debt/GDP ratio."
937053421,yes,0.6759,"Central banks and other policy makers will be making a terrible mistake if they look at low, stable inflation and pat themselves on the back for a job well done."
937053264,yes,0.6872,"But now we have Mitt Romney declaring his intention to replace Ben Bernanke for, um, pursuing aggressive monetary policy to fight a recession (not aggressive enough, but that’s another issue)."
937054575,yes,0.684,"If the situation continues to look like unraveling, I would expect Draghi to say something to reassure the markets that a Greek bank cutoff is not on the table."
937057051,yes,0.6565,"Again, not the thing most people will remember about Romney’s speech."
937053380,yes,1,"As the paper says, Although this effect is not long-lasting and debt eventually declines, it could be an issue if financial markets focus on the short-term behavior of the debt ratio, or if country authorities engage in repeated rounds of tightening in an effort to get the debt ratio to converge to the official target."
937053534,yes,1,This has led many to conclude that structural changes have occurred in the labor market and that the economy will not return to the low rates of unemployment that prevailed in the recent past.
937052950,yes,0.6667,And since some of the rise in income will be saved – and assuming that investment demand doesn’t rise by as much – a sufficiently large rise in GDP can restore equality between desired savings and desired investment at the new interest rate.
937053794,yes,0.6789,"As Rudi pointed out, the fall in the interest rate would induce investors to move their money abroad unless they expected the currency to rise."
937056006,yes,0.6489,The full list: Oklahoma Arizona Arkansas South Carolina Alabama Mississippi Georgia Texas Louisiana Florida These are places where summer would be really oppressive without air conditioning.
937054866,yes,0.6319,"If the initial shock is perceived as permanent, this process should go all the way: the rise in US demand leads to an equal rise in interest rates around the world, and most of the demand shock is effectively diffused abroad."
937053576,yes,0.6698,"We might add further that if the Fed can neutralize the supposedly awesome inflationary effect of quantitative easing by paying ¼ percent interest on reserves, it should be very easy to contain the inflationary threat in future."
937052735,yes,0.6612,"And there’s more — for example, Ireland went abruptly from having a stable real exchange rate against the UK to having a stable rate against Germany when it joined the European exchange rate mechanism, etc.. Incidentally, I suspect that this evidence is one reason why international macro people have tended to stay more Keynesian than domestic macro people — why those of us who read Obstfeld and Rogoff knew that Ricardian equivalence didn’t imply ineffectual fiscal policy, while even Nobel laureates on the domestic macro side were getting it wrong."
937052275,yes,0.6569,"There were fears that the Latin debt crisis would take down one or more money center banks — Citi, or Chase, say."
937052796,yes,0.6708,"On this view, the fact that the Fed is currently buying some large fraction of debt issuance is irrelevant; interest rates are determined by the willingness at the margin of private investors to hold the existing stock of debt, regardless."
937052584,yes,0.6904,"In this world, we’ll assume that no real investment is possible, so that loans are made only to finance consumption in excess of income."
937052261,yes,0.6542,Mark Thoma and David Altig both react to Arthur Laffer’s assertion that the increase in the monetary base presages huge inflation.
937052462,yes,0.6344,"Second, we see that investment has, if anything, fallen LESS than you might have expected given the plunge in the economy."
937055307,yes,0.6768,"And the Fed is very much thinking about the example of Sweden, which decided to hike rates out of vague concerns about financial stability, only to find itself staring at the very real risk of deflation."
937052616,yes,1,And I believe that some day — maybe in the first Chelsea Clinton administration — it will actually happen.
937056402,yes,1,"But the bigger question is what happens a year or two after Grexit, where the real risk to the euro is not that Greece will fail but that it will succeed."
937056968,yes,0.6803,"And the response of some — only some — Sanders supporters is disappointing, although I guess predictable given that somewhat similar things happened during the 2008 primary."
937054106,yes,0.6892,"As Wren-Lewis likes to say, on this basis the ideal policy is to shut half the economy down for a while, then start it up again — that way you get 100 percent growth."
937056277,yes,0.6663,"And Brad argues that the changing structure of the economy will mean that we want more of these goods, hence bigger government."
937053286,yes,0.665,"Now Lazear informs us that sure enough, mismatch was cyclical, and has in fact come way down even though unemployment remains high: What all this tells us is that the vast suffering still going on is gratuitous — that we could end this quickly with appropriate monetary and fiscal policies."
937052136,yes,1,"Suppose that we’re looking at an economy that, absent stimulus, would have an average unemployment rate of 9 percent over the next two years; this plan would cut that to 7.3 percent, which would be a help but could easily be spun by critics as a failure."
937052748,yes,0.6436,"This clearly implies a lower future tax burden than $100 billion a year forever, and therefore implies a fall in consumer spending of less than $100 billion per year."
937052903,yes,1,"If we are going to have Japan-type deflation, it obviously won’t happen for quite a while."
937057001,yes,0.6554,"And Clinton’s dogged realism, while it doesn’t inspire the same kind of uplift as Sanders’s promise of change, can be inspiring in its own way."
937056415,yes,0.6531,"If you go to the Conference Board numbers, you find that Finland has indeed seen a rapid rise in ULC, but not because of a wage explosion; it’s all about collapsing manufacturing productivity."
937056501,yes,0.6457,"In fact, given Greece’s starting point, with debt at 170 percent of GDP, the adverse effects of austerity mean that trying to raise the primary surplus by 1 point quickly causes the debt-GDP ratio to rise by 5 points (.03*170)."
937052893,yes,0.669,"The slump would be very prolonged, with an extended period of jobless recovery."
937057231,yes,1,Romney declares with horror that Trump would start a trade war.
937056745,yes,0.6676,"In this case, the BIS not only claims that low interest rates cause financial instability, but goes on to expound a sort of widow’s cruse theory of interest rates, in which low rates today lead to even lower rates tomorrow, because they produce bubbles that weaken the economy further when they burst."
937056041,yes,0.6534,"But Bernanke then goes on, as I understand him, to argue that international capital flows should solve the problem of secular stagnation unless if affects the world as a whole, because capital can seek higher returns abroad; he also argues that the global savings glut is mainly a thing of the past, and that in any case such problems can be addressed mainly by putting pressure on foreign governments to open their capital accounts and stop pursuing policies that promote excessive current account surpluses."
937052228,yes,1,"In any case, I thought it might be useful to re-explain why our current predicament can be thought of as a global excess of desired savings — which means that fiscal deficits won’t drive up interest rates unless they also expand the economy."
937052788,yes,0.6712,"The Ryan plan sharply cuts taxes on top income, yet if you look at the last page you’ll see that tax receipts are supposed to go up by almost $600 billion."
937056571,yes,0.6519,"I don’t watch financial news, but CNBC was on in the gym, so I was treated to a long ad from Ron Paul, who wants you to buy his video explaining the coming crisis brought on by loose money."
937055441,yes,0.6788,"Maybe full employment really is 5.3 percent unemployment, and by the time that’s clear the inflation rate will have ticked up a bit above the Fed’s target."
937055468,yes,0.6857,"It’s more or less standard international macro that with high capital mobility and floating exchange rates, demand shocks in any one country or region will be “shared” with other countries."
937054460,yes,0.6508,"If Greece were to adhere totally to the previous terms, over the next five years it would make resource transfers of about 20 percent of one year’s GDP."
937052474,yes,0.6571,"The Fed can print money, if you increase the supply of something its price will fall, end of story."
937052150,yes,0.6797,But here’s the thing: the estimates appear to be very close to what I’ve been getting.
937056853,yes,0.667,"The thing is that even if that would have worked (which it probably wouldn’t), it was inevitable that others would go the whole way and call for laissez-faire all the way, including monetary policy."
937057383,yes,1,"After the Super Tuesday primaries, Donald Trump will have the most pledged delegates."
937053085,yes,0.6734,"But the debt won’t be paid off all at once — and there’s no reason to expect the family to cut its spending right now by $100,000."
937056489,yes,1,"Instead, it will all be about handling bank panic, managing the transition to a new currency, and possibly removing structural obstacles to increased exports (which would very much include tourism)."
937052073,yes,0.6621,There’s every reason to think that the same thing will happen this time.
937052507,yes,0.6598,"Suppose that the economy is sufficiently depressed that with expected inflation at 3 percent, actual inflation comes out only 1; expectations will actually eventually catch up, so that if the economy remains depressed we’d expect inflation to go to -1; but if the economy remains depressed even longer, we’d expect inflation to go to -3, then -5, and so on."
937057042,yes,0.6654,"But it will also cut imports, which other things equal is expansionary."
937053036,yes,0.6499,"But Matt’s main point is that there are very good reasons why changing relative currency values is a lot easier than changing the whole structure of nominal wages and prices: Depreciation makes vacations in Spain cheap, it makes Spanish exports cheap, and it makes it attractive for rich foreigners to actually go buy up excess Spanish housing stock to use as vacation homes and such."
937053339,yes,1,"It will, however, depress employment even further and inflict a lot of direct suffering too through cuts in social programs."
937056265,yes,0.6487,"First, he argues that we should not only expect but want government to be substantially bigger in the future than it was in the past."
937052208,yes,0.694,"And a rightward shift of the IS curve won’t raise rates unless it’s big enough to push us to full employment, which doesn’t seem likely."
937053665,yes,0.6831,"And you might therefore argue that we can avoid secular stagnation by letting low interest rates lead to a debased dollar (hi, Congressman Ryan!"
937053087,yes,0.6277,"Now notice that this family is very much like the representative household in a Ricardian equivalence economy, reacting to a deficit financed infrastructure project like Lucas’s bridge; in this case the household really does know that today’s spending will reduce its future disposable income."
937057284,yes,1,And this will lead to inflation.
937056959,yes,1,"Beyond the politics, the Sanders “plan” isn’t just lacking in detail; as Ezra Klein notes, it both promises more comprehensive coverage than Medicare or for that matter single-payer systems in other countries, and assumes huge cost savings that are at best unlikely given that kind of generosity."
937052986,yes,0.6747,"Basically, the ECB pooh-poohs any notion that austerity would have major negative effects on the economy, suggests that it’s quite likely that the confidence fairy will make everything OK, and specifically says that Determined action on the part of governments to undertake fiscal and structural reforms is necessary to preserve stability and cohesion in the euro area."
937056980,yes,1,"Actually, I know what will happen on the Republican side: someone horrifying will come in first, and someone horrifying will come in second."
937056373,yes,1,"If a company is thinking about equipping its employees with smartphones that will be antiques in three years, the interest rate isn’t going to have much bearing on its decision; and a lot of business investment is like that, if not quite that extreme."
937054038,yes,1,"The central bank may (or may not, as seems to be true in Russia right now) be able to limit the currency plunge by raising interest rates (now above 13 percent on Russian 10-years), but only at the cost of deepening the recession."
937053229,yes,0.6433,"After the first decade After the first decade, Medicare is gradually transformed into a voucher scheme, with the value of the vouchers lagging well behind projected health care costs."
937052153,yes,0.6863,"They have the plan raising GDP by 3.7 percent, but that’s at peak; I thought 2.5 percent or so average over 2 years, again not much difference."
937057035,yes,0.669,"His proposed 35 percent tariff-like penalties would instigate a trade war and that would raise prices for consumers, kill our export jobs and lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all stripes to flee America."
937054091,yes,0.6718,"And here’s what the Volcker disinflation actually looked like: A temporary but huge surge in unemployment, with inflation coming down to a sustained lower level."
937057041,yes,0.6623,"This will cut exports, which other things equal depresses the economy."
937056398,yes,0.6884,"It would surely be ugly in Greece, at least at first."
937054054,yes,1,"You might think that it’s a fundamental insight that doubling the money supply will eventually double the price level, but what the models actually say is that doubling the current money supply and all future money supplies will double prices."
937053646,yes,0.696,"Second is downward nominal rigidity, which isn’t quite as binding a constraint, but does lead the Phillips curve to be non-vertical in the face of very low inflation; as an IMF study of persistent large output gaps found, even years of a deeply depressed economy tend to produce at most slow, grinding deflation, and more usually slight positive inflation, not the ever-accelerating deflation the standard model would have predicted."
937055316,yes,0.6605,"But they go on to say that the real lower bound comes from the fact that bank deposits are more useful than currency in a safe, because you can write checks and all that."
937052930,yes,1,"That was Keynes’s whole point in The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill — not that the return to gold at too high a parity would mean depression forever, but that it would subject Britain to years of unnecessary suffering."
937054877,yes,0.6849,"The dollar is rising a lot, which suggests that markets regard the relative rise in US demand as a fairly long-term phenomenon – which in turn should mean that a lot of the rise in US demand ends up benefiting other countries."
937056502,yes,1,So this might suggest that it would take 5 years of austerity just to get the debt ratio back to where it would have been in the absence of austerity.
937052389,yes,0.6651,"On the contrary, by dumping dollars China would be doing us a favor."
937053635,yes,0.6425,"In monetary policy, two zeroes — the hard zero on interest rates and the soft zero on wage changes — can, all too easily, give central bankers a de facto license to let the economy stagnate, remaining far below potential for an indefinite length of time."
937053746,yes,0.6697,"But, you say, wouldn’t China selling our bonds send interest rates up and depress the U.S. economy?"
937052845,yes,0.6732,"But – you probably guessed where I’m going – what if even a zero rate isn’t low enough; that is, low enough to induce enough dissaving on the part of the Janets to match the savings of the Sams?"
937056238,yes,0.6559,"In effect, European bond markets are flashing a secular stagnation warning."
937053653,yes,0.6707,"Romer’s notes still imply that a protracted liquidity trap should lead to accelerating deflation, which doesn’t seem to happen; I think most of us have turned to downward nominal wage rigidity as an explanation."
937056761,yes,0.669,Cardiff Garcia excerpts a passage in which he explains why we should care about the concentration of wealth at the top: [T]here is a danger that the rapid growth of top incomes can become self-reinforcing through the political access that money can bring.
937053960,yes,0.668,"Finally, there’s the confidence fairy: demand-side economics is valid, but business hates big government so much that any attempt to use fiscal policy will backfire."
937052494,yes,0.6565,But it would be a big mistake to count on monetary policy alone.
937057376,yes,0.6699,"That’s a big subject, but one thing is for sure: given the pressures from abroad, and the worrying strength of the dollar, the Federal Reserve really, really needs to hold off on raising interest rates."
937053356,yes,0.6424,"The point, however, is that it may take a long time — and there’s massive pain along the way."
937052663,yes,1,"And I’m sure that they’ll keep on believing that, for years to come."
937054447,yes,1,Unemployment would fall by around 10 percentage points relative to no relief.
937053192,yes,1,Would Keynesians have been willing to change their views drastically if the experience of the global financial crisis had warranted such a change?
937054466,yes,0.6907,"With Greece running a primary surplus, all new loans — and then some — are going to pay principal and interest on old loans, with less than nothing going to the Greeks."
937055442,yes,0.6663,"But that would not be a large cost, whereas sliding back into the liquidity trap would be very, very costly."
937052594,yes,1,"And this will be destructive; not only will output be below potential, but depressed incomes and deflation will make it harder for the Sams to pay down their debt."
937056707,yes,0.6593,"I think those arguments are wrong — but in any case they have nothing to do with the notion that current rates are somehow artificial, that we should let rates be determined by “supply and demand”."
937055444,yes,0.6379,Matt O’Brien catches a piece by Dick Morris a few years ago predicting that Obama’s legacy would be stagflation.
937054319,yes,0.6902,Suppose that the multiplier is 1.3 — which is what IMF estimates seem to suggest — and that Greece can collect 40 percent of a rise in GDP in revenue (roughly matching its average revenue/GDP).
937053752,yes,0.6735,But that would be good for America!
937056997,yes,0.652,Don’t say there’s nothing there: a propaganda machine that could turn John Kerry into a coward can turn a nice guy from Brooklyn into a monstrously flawed specimen of humanity in no time at all.
937052215,yes,0.6614,"If the government introduces a new program that will spend $100 billion a year forever, then taxes must ultimately go up by the present-value equivalent of $100 billion forever."
937052851,yes,0.6578,"Yes, that will in a way be rewarding their past excesses – but economics is not a morality play."
937053722,yes,0.6872,"As Romer points out in his notes, this can be reinterpreted as an open-economy model if we let capital flows be influenced by the exchange rate (most international econ types tend to think in terms of stocks rather than flows, but it doesn’t really matter here), so that a lower interest rate leads to currency depreciation."
937055583,yes,1,"What the economic logic says, however, is that if that’s really true, the dollar will just keep heading higher until the drag gets less moderate."
937052314,yes,0.6277,"And if we’re facing a Japanese-type lost decade, which seems all too possible, long rates are in fact still unreasonably high."
937056556,yes,0.6752,"So you would expect GDP growth to pick up, other things equal, if there is a slowdown in the pace of tightening even if austerity isn’t actually reversed."
937056946,yes,0.697,"Sanders is still a long shot for the nomination, but is a serious enough contender that he deserves some real scrutiny."
937056725,yes,0.6865,"But it’s an interest group that has a lot of clout among central bankers, because these are people they see every day — and in many cases are people they will become once they go through the revolving door."
937057333,yes,1,"Meanwhile, I think that Trump would be a very weak general election candidate — the conditions that have let him flourish in the GOP are really unique to that party."
937056151,yes,1,But this isn’t right if the weakness in European demand is perceived as temporary (where that could mean a number of years).
937057151,yes,1,"The proximate cause is obvious: policy interest rates are very low, and expected to remain low, so money is pouring into alternative assets, driving their yields down too."
937057347,yes,1,In his stop-Trump speech last week he warned that if The Donald became president America would “sink into prolonged recession.”
937053373,yes,0.6933,If the negative impact of these cuts is fairly large — which all the evidence coming in suggests is the case under current liquidity-trap conditions — and if the country starts from a fairly high level of debt — as the austerity countries do — something alarming is likely to happen.
937056823,yes,0.6596,"You made predictions that Very Serious People scoffed at — that as long as we were at the zero lower bound massive increases in the monetary base wouldn’t be inflationary, that budget deficits would not drive up interest rates — and also predicted large multipliers from fiscal policy, in particular nasty consequences of austerity."
937056508,yes,1,"And it suggests that a 1 point rise in the primary surplus, which requires austerity that causes a 3-point fall in real GDP, will reduce inflation by about 0.7 percentage points (3*0.23)."
937054143,yes,1,I think if you were going to name the two current econoheroes of U.S. liberals they would probably be Joe Stiglitz and yours truly.
937053516,yes,0.6472,"First, his reaction to the fact that even in 2010 it was obvious that markets weren’t performing according to his predictions: This is regrettable, because it is fostering a sense of complacency that can have dire consequences… My analysis can’t be wrong, the markets are just misbehaving!"
937052254,yes,0.6661,"It does NOT crowd out private spending, at least not until the excess supply of savings has been sopped up, which is the same thing as saying not until the economy has escaped from the liquidity trap."
937052850,yes,1,"One answer is inflation, if you can get it, which will do two things: it will make it possible to have a negative real interest rate, and it will in itself erode the debt of the Sams."
937053206,yes,0.6746,"And TPM documents the latest example: President Obama would have this election in the bag, according to a number of leading columnists, if only he would act more like President Obama."
937053795,yes,0.6733,And the only way that could happen was for the currency to depreciate past its long-run value – to overshoot – so that it could be expected to appreciate back to that value over time.
937053084,yes,0.6469,"But the family has also taken on debt, and will presumably spend less because it knows that it has to pay off that debt."
937056244,yes,1,"What this in turn implies is that even if you downplay domestic U.S. weakness and focus on the export of capital from other countries, especially Germany, there’s no good reason to believe that this new version of the global savings glut will end any time soon."
937054871,yes,0.6758,"In case #1, everyone sees the relative strength of US spending as temporary – either they see it as a one-time blip that will go away, or they expect the rest of the world to exhibit a similar surge in demand in the not-too-distant future."
937053717,yes,0.652,"As I’ve written before, I just don’t see how this is supposed to happen in a country with its own currency that doesn’t have a lot of foreign currency debt – especially if the country is currently in a liquidity trap, with monetary policy constrained by the zero lower bound on interest rates."
937052139,yes,0.6605,"Yet even if the plan gets the hoped-for 80 votes in the Senate, which seems doubtful, responsibility for the plan’s perceived failure, if it’s spun that way, will be placed on Democrats."
937054577,yes,1,"Ideals aside, the consequences of playing hardball with Greece over its banks could very easily be immense."
937057019,yes,1,"But it will also cut imports, which other things equal is expansionary."
937054061,yes,1,"(And Ricardian equivalence, for what it’s worth, says that it would have no effect even if you could do it — households would know that future taxes will have to rise to pay for today’s gift, and save all of it.)"
937053143,yes,0.6513,"No wonder, then, that the whole austerity enterprise is spiraling into disaster."
937057385,yes,0.671,Bernie Sanders Will Make the Economy Great Again
937053550,yes,0.6496,"In his “Comments on the critics” (of his Monetary Framework) Friedman described the “London School (really Austrian) view” that the depression was an inevitable result of the prior boom, that it was deepened by the attempts to prevent prices and wages from falling and firms from going bankrupt, that the monetary authorities had brought on the depression by inflationary policies before the crash and had prolonged it by “easy money” policies thereafter; that the only sound policy was to let the depression run its course, bring down money costs, and eliminate weak and unsound firms."
937056794,yes,1,"That is, they believed that reforms could create enough flexibility to mainly neutralize Milton Friedman’s warning that in the face of negative shocks, countries with fixed exchange rates would suffer large costs: If the external changes are deep-seated and persistent, the unemployment produces steady downward pressure on prices and wages, and the adjustment will not have been completed until the deflation has run its sorry course."
937054580,yes,0.6673,"Grexit — the often speculated about, never so far materializing Greek exit from the euro — becomes a very real possibility if European creditors try to exert leverage by taking away the safety net for Greek banks."
937056723,yes,0.6852,"But nobody has ever accused bankers of being especially clear about macroeconomics, and in any case what matters for today’s bank executives is not the long run but the next few years, during which they either will or won’t be getting big bonuses; in the long run they are all full-time golfers."
937054166,yes,0.6607,"I’m very worried that the Fed may be gearing up to raise rates too soon; he’s sanguine, considering the risk of a Japan-type trap in the US minimal and the case for a rate hike this year solid."
937056678,yes,0.669,So you have spectacles like John Kerry and Barack Obama declaring that one big risk from rejecting an Iran deal (which I very much support) would be a threat to the role of the dollar.
937052310,yes,0.6842,"Now, you could and should be worried if this thing looked like a great bubble — if long-term rates looked unreasonably low given the fundamentals."
937054422,yes,1,Unemployment would fall by around 10 percentage points relative to no relief.
937056793,yes,0.6301,"Advocates knew that, to withstand the rigours of a fixed-exchange system that resembles nothing so much as the gold standard, countries would have to adjust to economic shocks through shifts in wages and prices — a course, they believed, that the euro’s members would be forced to take."
937054130,yes,0.677,Another good employment report — and another triumph for future Republican policies (hahahahaha) — and there will be many voices calling on the Fed to accelerate its tightening.
937053633,yes,0.674,"It might do that, or fiscal policy might be forced into action, if the economy really were suffering from accelerating deflation; but instead all you see is low inflation, which might even lead some central bankers to declare that they were doing their job just fine."
937054424,yes,0.6569,But even a partial move in the direction I’ve described could have quite significant positive effects on Greek welfare.
937053766,yes,1,"Estimating the rate of mean-reversion is tricky, but we can more or less sidestep this by looking at long-term expectations: after a decade, we can expect the bulk of any deviation from the norm to be eliminated."
937054751,yes,0.6509,"Not to keep you in suspense, here’s the punchline: the US economy reaps the bulk of the gains from rising demand relative to other countries if and only if that relative rise is perceived by markets as temporary."
937056031,yes,0.6488,"But there’s a substantive difference in views, in which Bernanke correctly, I’d argue, criticizes Summers for insufficient attention to international capital flows – but then argues that once you do allow for international capital movement it obviates many of the secular stagnation concerns, which I believe is wrong."
937056932,yes,1,"Again, I say this as someone who favors single-payer — but it’s just not going to happen anytime soon."
937053338,yes,1,"Shaving an extra couple of points off the structural deficit will make very little difference to long-run solvency, nor will it do much to accelerate the pace of internal devaluation."
937057278,yes,1,"Actually, that’s unlikely — I see no prospect that Japan will put off the tax hike forever."
937056152,yes,0.6628,"For in that case the weakness of the euro will also be seen as temporary: the further it falls, the faster investors will expect it to rise back to a “normal” level in the future."
937053750,yes,1,"And even if Chinese sales somehow put a squeeze on longer maturities, the Fed could just engage in more quantitative easing and buy those bonds up."
937052147,yes,0.68,"Kudos, by the way, to the administration-in-waiting for providing this — it will be a joy to argue policy with an administration that provides comprehensible, honest reports, not case studies in how to lie with statistics."
937056391,yes,0.6566,"The essence of the Greek situation is that the actual parameters of a short-run deal are clear and unavoidable: Greece can’t run a primary budget deficit, because nobody will lend it new money, and it won’t (and basically can’t) run a large primary surplus, because you can’t squeeze even more blood from that stone."
937053658,yes,1,"This meant that we needed more domestic demand, other things equal, to achieve full employment — and arguably that we needed a series of bubbles and rising leverage, which are no longer forthcoming."
937052777,yes,0.6634,"I would say that if it’s right, it’s far from clear that the recovery will prove self-sustaining."
937052471,yes,0.6807,"The question is whether, at the zero bound, the Fed has the ability to increase aggregate demand — full stop."
937056153,yes,1,And this expected appreciation back toward normality will equalize expected returns after a decline in the euro that is well short of being enough to raise the natural rate of interest all the way to its level abroad.
937054443,yes,1,"A relaxation of austerity would run this process in reverse; the extra spending would mean a stronger economy, which means more revenue, which means that the primary surplus wouldn’t fall as much."
937052113,yes,0.6703,"“I suspect that we are coming to the end of this downtrend, as applications for new mortgages, the most important series, have flattened out .."
937057403,yes,0.6624,"Then again, we might be talking about President Trump."
937054423,yes,1,"OK, this is not going to happen — even in the best of circumstances, Syriza is going to be able to get a relaxation of the primary surplus requirement, not complete abrogation."
937053484,yes,0.6841,"Looser monetary policy could help achieve these things, but bear in mind that the ECB, like the Fed, is basically up against the zero lower bound."
937054752,yes,1,"If it’s seen as permanent – if, say, investors see strong US demand but Europe stuck in secular stagnation – we should expect a strong dollar to undo a lot of the gains."
937054458,yes,0.6827,"The question is how much Greece will transfer to its creditors by running primary surpluses — and yes, at this point that’s the question, there’s no possibility that the creditors will transfer more resources to Greece."
937055866,yes,1,"Large budget deficits, which shift GG, won’t raise rates."
937055888,yes,1,"That’s actually why I was predicting a sluggish recovery well in advance, and in fact well before the Reinhart-Rogoff aftermath paper came out."
937052506,yes,1,"But here’s the thing: the inflation-adjusted Phillips curve predicts not just deflation, but accelerating deflation in the face of a really prolonged economic slump."
937052414,yes,0.696,For “most of what would be effective in remedying a depression would be equally effective in preventing this adjustment.” And Hayek found it …still more difficult to see what lasting good effects can come from credit expansion.
937052224,yes,0.6668,"Niall Ferguson “explaining” that fiscal expansion will actually be contractionary, because it will drive up interest rates."
937056048,yes,1,"You might think not: as long as there are positive-return investments abroad, capital will flow out."
937056456,yes,0.6681,"And not incidentally, you might think that the debacle in Kansas would finally kill any notion that conservatives know the secrets of rapid growth."
937053086,yes,1,"Its annual mortgage payment will be something like $6,000, so maybe you would expect a fall in spending by $6000; that offsets only a small fraction of the debt-financed purchase."
937053058,yes,1,"Ricardian equivalence says that what determines consumption is the lifetime present value of after-tax income, and hence that, say, a temporary tax cut won’t stimulate spending, because people will figure that whatever they gain now will be offset by higher taxes later."
937056889,yes,1,"and Trump are proposing cuts that would do more fiscal damage than anything W enacted, with the following estimates of the 10-year increase in debt as a percentage of GDP: W: 18.2 Jeb: 28.2 Trump: 39.2 To get a picture of distribution, here’s the change in after-tax income for the middle quintile, the top 1 percent, and the top 0.1 percent: So the current crop of candidates, even the supposedly moderate ones, are proposing to blow a bigger hole in the budget than W ever did, and use the extra debt to do even more to increase inequality."
937055609,yes,0.6702,"A better model might be Europe’s Single Market Act, which the European Commission now estimates added 1.8 percent to real incomes; but Eichengreen and Boltho suggest that about half of that reflects policy changes that would have happened anyway."
937052520,yes,1,"Second, it offers a reason — above and beyond concerns about the zero lower bound — to target a significantly positive inflation rate: at low inflation, more prices and wages will “want” to fall, but be blocked by downward rigidity; so even in the long run, the Phillips curve isn’t vertical at low inflation, and you can get permanently lower unemployment by accepting, say, 4 percent inflation rather than insisting on stable prices."
937054093,yes,0.6436,"On the contrary, they were feeling pretty smug: disinflation had played out exactly the way the models in their textbooks said it should."
937052370,yes,0.6842,"What this tells us is that inflation tends to be self-perpetuating, unless there’s a big excess of either supply or demand."
937052429,yes,0.6668,That credibility could be meaningfully undermined if we were to take actions that were unlikely to yield clear and significant benefits.
937052328,yes,0.6852,"A good sample is this piece from Morgan Stanley, according to which “Our US economics team expects bond yields to rise to 5.5% by the end of 2010 – an increase of 220bp that outstrips the 137bp increase in the fed funds rate expected over the same horizon.” Btw: what?"
937053631,yes,0.6301,"Second is downward nominal rigidity, which isn’t quite as binding a constraint, but does lead the Phillips curve to be non-vertical in the face of very low inflation; as an IMF study of persistent large output gaps found, even years of a deeply depressed economy tend to produce at most slow, grinding deflation, and more usually slight positive inflation, not the ever-accelerating deflation the standard model would have predicted."
937052551,yes,1,What’s the problem?” And the slump will just go on.
937052956,yes,0.6673,And the Fed can move the interest rate by changing the money supply: increase the supply of money and the interest rate must fall to induce people to hold a larger quantity.
937053932,yes,0.68,"But Singer will get very angry if you make fun of him; in fact, he denounces reporting that points out how wrong he and others have been as the “Krugmanization” of the media, a term I’ll adopt with pride."
937053762,yes,0.6525,"The idea is that relative purchasing power parity more or less holds in the long run, so you can assume that Japanese inflation equals US inflation plus change in the exchange rate."
937054016,yes,0.6724,"The gains from falling prices exceed the losses, and if the marginal propensity to spend is similar that should tell the tale for aggregate demand."
937057203,yes,1,"Roughly, the natural rate of interest is the rate that would lead to stable inflation at more or less full employment."
937052596,yes,1,"One answer is inflation, if you can get it, which will do two things: it will make it possible to have a negative real interest rate, and it will in itself erode the debt of the Sams."
937057280,yes,0.684,"After all, suppose investors conclude that Japan will never raise taxes enough to service its debt."
937053368,yes,0.663,"I don’t think they’re right; but even if they are, I’m not clear what they believe would happen next."
937053890,yes,0.6875,"Ezra Klein directs us to the latest from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which asks what the average Obamacare 2015 premium increase will be for those places for which we have full information — and finds that premiums will actually decline slightly."
937052747,yes,0.6318,"But suppose that the increase in government spending is temporary, not permanent — that it will increase spending by $100 billion per year for only 1 or 2 years, not forever."
937055867,yes,1,"However, changes in spending, positive or negative – e.g., harsh austerity — will have an unusually large effect on output, because they can’t be offset by changes in interest rates."
937052243,yes,0.641,"In the modern world, we often take a shortcut and just assume that the central bank adjusts the money supply so as to achieve a target interest rate, in effect choosing a point on the IS curve."
937055040,yes,1,"Or to turn this around, to achieve the extra three points of surplus the troika is demanding, Greece would actually have to find more than 6 points of GDP in spending cuts or tax hikes."
937052334,yes,0.6907,"Morgan Stanley, September 2006: The pessimists argue that the bursting of a putative housing bubble means that prices could decline significantly."
937052371,yes,1,"In particular, once expectations of, say, persistent 10 percent inflation have become “embedded” in the economy, it will take a major period of slack — years of high unemployment — to get that rate down."
937057101,yes,0.679,“Inexperienced traders will have to tackle markets without the central bank’s artificially low interest rates …” [my emphasis].
937056422,yes,1,"The whole single currency project was flawed from the start, and will keep generating new crises even if Europe somehow gets through this one."
937056812,yes,0.669,But of course they never will.
937052217,yes,1,"But suppose that the increase in government spending is temporary, not permanent — that it will increase spending by $100 billion per year for only 1 or 2 years, not forever."
937052326,yes,1,"The longer high unemployment drags on, the greater the odds that crazy people will win big in the midterm elections — dooming us to economic policy failure on a truly grand scale."
937054728,yes,0.6714,"In fact, they’re ducking the truly hard issues — because let’s face it, stimulus and austerity, QE or not, are politically charged issues where taking any kind of stand will get you attacked."
937057138,yes,0.6371,"Surely the same people, if you had asked them a few years ago about what would happen if the Fed tried to suppress interest rates by massively expanding its balance sheet, would have predicted runaway inflation."
937052519,yes,0.6729,"First of all, it explains how sustained gradual deflation can persist."
937053627,yes,1,"But anyway, suppose the economy is depressed; this will lead to steadily falling inflation, which will lead the central bank to keep cutting interest rates (and because the inflation coefficient in Taylor rules is always bigger than one, this means cutting real rates); and eventually the interest rate will fall enough to restore full employment."
937053481,yes,0.6608,"OK, then: either the euro must go or something must be done to make it work, because what we’re seeing (and the Portuguese are experiencing) is unacceptable."
937052982,yes,0.6543,It now appears that as of today European leaders have boldly agreed to … announce something or other later in the week.
937055876,yes,0.6576,"Many never learned simple macro models – if it doesn’t involve microfoundations and rational expectations, preferably with difficult math, it must be nonsense."
937052947,yes,0.6741,Must it rise back to its original level?
937053857,yes,0.6208,It can raise the interest rate on reserves; it can sell securities.
937055461,yes,0.6688,Obviously none of this would work if I hadn’t at some level made the decision that I needed to fight this aging thing.
937057255,yes,0.6892,"Now we have plunging commodity prices and a flood of money out of emerging markets; clearly, this shows that the Fed must do the right thing, and raise rates."
937056588,yes,0.6707,"You can try as hard as you like to tell such people that monetary policy is mainly a technical problem, that the Fed isn’t giving money away, and that predictions of runaway inflation have been utterly wrong; it will make no difference."
937057080,yes,0.703,"In some ways, they may have gotten even worse."
937052805,yes,0.6772,And so I don’t expect rates to spike when QE2 ends unless there’s good economic news that gives us a reason to believe that the zero-rate policy on short-term rates will end sooner than expected.
937053650,yes,1,"In monetary policy, two zeroes — the hard zero on interest rates and the soft zero on wage changes — can, all too easily, give central bankers a de facto license to let the economy stagnate, remaining far below potential for an indefinite length of time."
937052899,yes,0.676,"Sustained high unemployment would keep wages and core inflation low, and quite likely push us toward Japan-style deflation."
937053299,yes,0.6444,"I wrote about this way back: the usual suspects seized on the Census bulge in employment as evidence of a big-government surge; and because nobody in that business ever admits having been wrong, this became a “fact” that people like Rand Paul believe."
937052995,yes,0.676,"The problem is that taking on that commitment could very quickly push France into non-AAA status, collapsing the whole thing."
937053221,yes,1,"First, he insists that the tax cuts won’t reduce revenue, because they’ll be offset with unspecified “base-broadening”."
937052100,yes,1,That’s why I think our current problems will last a long time.
937052566,yes,0.6578,But this will be accompanied by an actual surplus of labor in other occupations.
937056669,yes,0.6674,"China could just let the renminbi float; given the current state of the Chinese economy, that would surely mean a large depreciation."
937053226,yes,0.6737,"Second, there are large assumed cuts in discretionary spending relative to current policy — again, CBO: That combination of other mandatory and discretionary spending was specified to decline from 12 percent of GDP in 2010 to about 6 percent in 2021 and then move in line with the GDP price deflator beginning in 2022, which would generate a further decline relative to GDP."
937056111,yes,1,"This will drive down the value of the euro, increasing net exports, and raising the Wicksellian natural rate."
937054585,yes,0.6778,"In particular, think about what happens if Greece leaves the euro and then manages to find its footing — which it probably would after a chaotic year or two."
937052823,yes,0.6906,"I guess that’s the problem with blogging: even if you explain your position clearly, after a few months people enter the discussion without knowing about or having forgotten the earlier discussion."
937052496,yes,0.6781,"The Fed can control short-term interest rates, it can influence long rates — there’s a world of difference between those two statements."
937056633,yes,0.6813,"And this in turn had strong policy implications: you might see a relationship between money and output, but it would disappear if you tried to use it."
937052214,yes,1,"Here’s what we agree on: if consumers have perfect foresight, live forever, have perfect access to capital markets, etc., then they will take into account the expected future burden of taxes to pay for government spending."
937057283,yes,1,"No, what they might fear is monetization: Japan will print lots of yen to cover deficits."
937052117,yes,1,"The bottom line is this: we’re probably looking at a plan that will shave less than 2 percentage points off the average unemployment rate for the next two years, and possibly quite a lot less."
937055041,yes,0.6826,"And note that the multiplier is almost surely greater than one; this means that the fall in government spending would induce a fall in private spending too, which is an additional excess burden from the austerity."
937054445,yes,0.6776,"Then an additional billion euros in spending should generate around 0.5 billion euros in revenue, reducing the primary surplus by only 0.5 billion euros."
937056497,yes,1,"In fact, a good guess is that you’d have to slash spending by 2 percent of GDP, because austerity shrinks the economy and reduces tax receipts."
937056315,yes,0.6493,"What the IMF tells us is that such attempts to increase saving actually lead to lower, not higher, investment – and since saving equals investment, actual savings fall."
937052236,yes,1,"There may also be a rise in investment demand, but ordinarily we’d expect the savings rise to be larger, so that the interest rate falls: So supply and demand for funds doesn’t tell you what the interest rate is — not by itself."
937052218,yes,0.6922,"This clearly implies a lower future tax burden than $100 billion a year forever, and therefore implies a fall in consumer spending of less than $100 billion per year."
937053415,yes,0.6749,"Another possibility, however, which I at least noted fairly early on, was that downward nominal wage rigidity could explain why the fairly rapid falls in inflation seen in previous slumps weren’t happening this time; if wages are “reluctant” to actually fall, inflation becomes “sticky” at low levels even with a very depressed economy."
937055003,yes,1,"The new Greek leaders will succeed or fail, personally, based on what happens to Greece; there will be no consolation prizes for failing conventionally."
937054441,yes,1,You might think that this would let the Greeks spend an additional 4.5 percent of GDP — but the benefits to Greece would actually be much bigger than that.
937056667,yes,0.6763,This is a recipe for convincing investors that the future direction of the currency is down — which means that capital flight will accelerate (and apparently already has.)
937053042,yes,0.667,And it takes time.
937054858,yes,0.6576,"And in normal times the central bank will adjust the interest rate to stabilize the economy, which for current purposes we can think of as meaning that it achieves full employment."
937056747,yes,0.6716,"Or put it this way: if, say, Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders were to invent whole new, dubious economic theories to justify the policies they clearly want for other reasons, everyone would be coming down on them hard for being flaky and irresponsible."
937053571,yes,1,Except that this isn’t at all a surprise; it’s exactly what those of us who had analyzed the liquidity trap predicted would happen when you expand the monetary base in an economy at the zero lower bound.
937054602,yes,0.6306,"So ULC should rise over time, by 2 percent a year."
937057285,yes,0.6659,"So a loss of fiscal credibility would lead to expectations of future inflation, which is a problem for Abe’s efforts to, um, get people to expect inflation rather than deflation, because … what?"
937056499,yes,0.6892,"So, a 3 percent hit to GDP to raise the primary surplus by 1."
937057129,yes,1,"So no crowding out, no reason interest rates should rise."
937052368,yes,1,"Then at the time I reset my prices, they’ll probably be about 5 percent lower than they “should” be; add that effect to the anticipation of future inflation, and I’ll probably mark up my price by 10 percent — even if supply and demand are more or less balanced right now."
937057018,yes,1,"This will cut exports, which other things equal depresses the economy."
937057277,yes,0.667,"Supposedly, Japan would lose credibility."
937057400,yes,0.6587,"There’s also the collateral damage such a turn would inflict on poor countries. "
937053321,yes,0.6754,"But the odds are that they are wrong, and that they’re sacrificing their own credibility to put charlatans and cranks in the driver’s seat."
937056491,yes,1,"The betting markets now believe that Greece will vote “no”, but nobody really knows even now."
937052144,yes,0.6831,Obama estimates of what the American Association of Retired Persons American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan would accomplish.
937054739,yes,0.6472,"More than that, as Fatas points out, rising debt could be a good sign."
937054878,yes,0.6836,"In other words, the strong dollar probably is going to be a major drag on recovery."
937052745,yes,1,"If the government introduces a new program that will spend $100 billion a year forever, then taxes must ultimately go up by the present-value equivalent of $100 billion forever."
937052610,yes,0.6759,"What I meant is that (a) health care costs will have to be controlled, which will surely require having Medicare and Medicaid decide what they’re willing to pay for — not really death panels, of course, but consideration of medical effectiveness and, at some point, how much we’re willing to spend for extreme care (b) we’ll need more revenue — several percent of GDP — which might most plausibly come from a value-added tax And if we do those two things, we’re most of the way toward a sustainable budget."
937053902,yes,0.6747,"For one thing, the huge surge in enrollments late in the day meant that the risk pool this year is better than insurers expected, and they now expect 2015 to be better still."
937053300,yes,0.6854,"He wouldn’t have made this mistake if he ever read or listened to an analysis from nonpartisan sources, but he evidently doesn’t."
937056550,yes,0.6757,And it looks as if there’s a lot more failing conventionally in Europe’s future.
937052686,yes,0.6843,"And let’s make two assumptions: first, Germany’s economy is three times the size of Spain’s, so that German inflation is 3/4 of the overall index, Spain’s inflation 1/4; second, past events have left Spanish wages and prices 20 percent logarithmic too high relative to Germany."
937052329,yes,0.6691,Almost everyone expects unemployment in late 2010 to remain close to 10%.
937056978,yes,0.6566,"Anyway, I’m not going to obsess over this — this too shall pass, just like the 2008 primary season when I was history’s greatest monster because I was skeptical about the Obama promise of transformation."
937056706,yes,1,"Not exactly what we’ve seen in the era of zero rates and QE: OK, there are arguments that the Fed should be willing to abandon its inflation target so as to discourage bubbles."
937056482,yes,0.6677,Suppose that there were a way to end this depression.
937052794,yes,0.6444,"On this view asset purchases matter because over time they change the stocks of assets available : by buying long term federal debt, the Fed takes some of that debt off the market, and hence drives up the price of what’s left, reducing interest rates."
937053861,yes,1,The point is that this has to be one of the weakest policy arguments I’ve ever seen: Arguing that the Fed should shy away from doing all it can to create jobs because you’re afraid that at some point in the future Fed officials will be insufficiently hawkish because they’re afraid that people will make fun of them.
937052761,yes,0.6545,"If a company is thinking about equipping its employees with smartphones that will be antiques in three years, the interest rate isn’t going to have much bearing on its decision; and a lot of business investment is like that, if not quite that extreme."
937052604,yes,1,"And he’ll also make it easier for the Sams to pay down their debt; if he keeps it up long enough, he can bring them to the point where they’re no longer so severely balance-sheet constrained, and further deficit spending is no longer required to achieve full employment."
937054444,yes,0.687,Suppose that the multiplier is 1.3 — which is what IMF estimates seem to suggest — and that Greece can collect 40 percent of a rise in GDP in revenue (roughly matching its average revenue/GDP).
937052815,yes,1,"The Fed can control short-term interest rates, it can influence long rates — there’s a world of difference between those two statements."
937057033,yes,1,"In warning about Trumponomics, Romney declared If Donald Trump’s plans were ever implemented, the country would sink into prolonged recession."
937057020,yes,0.6843,"For the world as a whole, the cuts in exports and imports will by definition be equal, so as far as world demand is concerned, trade wars are a wash. OK, I’m sure some people will start shouting “Krugman says protectionism does no harm.” But no: protectionism in general should reduce efficiency, and hence the economy’s potential output."
937057180,yes,0.6651,"This was supposed to be the interest rate consistent with price stability; if the central bank tried to keep rates below this level, it might be able to for a while, but the result would be an overheating economy and accelerating inflation."
937053487,yes,0.6747,"I don’t think it’s a waste of time to discuss how that misplaced focus happened, including the unfortunate role played by some economists who have done fine work in the past and will presumably do fine work in the future."
937056487,yes,0.6649,"On the other hand, Grexit would produce a rapid improvement in competitiveness, at the cost of possible financial chaos.This is not a route anyone has been willing to go down, but one does have to say that as the crisis worsens it becomes a more plausible outcome."
937053858,yes,0.649,But he worries that it won’t do these things because it will be embarrassed if it finds itself paying more in interest than it is earning on its portfolio.
937053876,yes,0.6789,"This isn’t what you usually hear — the 70s have taken on mythical status, and are constantly invoked by inflation worriers, while the 80s get mentioned, if at all, as somehow proving the truth of supply-side economics."
937053728,yes,1,"If LM doesn’t shift, the interest rate will rise, but only because the loss of investor confidence is actually, through depreciation, having an expansionary effect."
937052432,yes,0.6674,And these assertions about how markets will react are (a) not based on any actual evidence (b) actually assume that markets will behave irrationally This goes for both fiscal and monetary policy.
937052838,yes,0.6698,"In this world, we’ll assume that no real investment is possible, so that loans are made only to finance consumption in excess of income."
937054316,yes,1,You might think that this would let the Greeks spend an additional 4.5 percent of GDP — but the benefits to Greece would actually be much bigger than that.
937052709,yes,0.6547,"Scott Sumner sends us to David Glasner, who shows that stock prices have had a positive correlation with expected inflation since 2008, strongly suggesting that aggregate demand is at the heart of our problems."
937053374,yes,0.6785,"Instead of falling, the ratio of debt to GDP is likely to rise for years."
937055469,yes,0.671,"If you have exceptionally strong demand, your currency will rise, crimping your own growth while boosting growth abroad; if you have exceptionally weak demand, you will get partial compensation via a weaker currency that helps net exports."
937056241,yes,1,"Sure enough, if we try to figure out the market’s implied prediction for the euro, it seems to imply persistent weakness."
937056722,yes,0.6548,"Now, you can argue, as Brad DeLong does, that easy money is in the long-run interest of commercial banks — that in the end the nominal interest rate depends on the rate of inflation, and that locking us into a lowflation or deflation world would be very bad for the banks."
937054861,yes,1,"So this increase in demand will be reflected not in higher output, but in a rise in interest rates."
937053946,yes,0.6406,But why do the AKs claim this will happen?
937057348,yes,1,"Why? The only specific reason he gave was that those duties would “instigate a trade war and that would raise prices for consumers, kill our export jobs and lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all stripes to flee America.”"
937056421,yes,0.6867,"The problems of the euro, in other words, weren’t caused by an outbreak of fiscal irresponsibility that won’t recur if the Greeks can be brought to heel; they weren’t even, in a deep sense, the result of big capital flows that won’t come back again."
937055457,yes,0.6599,"You might say that the truth will show up on the scale and your waistline eventually; yes, but that’s too future oriented."
937053200,yes,0.6761,"Yet this truth is precisely what the critics won’t acknowledge, because that would endanger their comfortable position of scolding everyone equally."
937054318,yes,1,"A relaxation of austerity would run this process in reverse; the extra spending would mean a stronger economy, which means more revenue, which means that the primary surplus wouldn’t fall as much."
937054449,yes,0.6513,But even a partial move in the direction I’ve described could have quite significant positive effects on Greek welfare.
937052644,yes,1,"The model, and more broadly overall logic, suggests that there is good no reason why the economy has to suffer a large loss of output and employment after a Minsky moment."
937054421,yes,0.6651,"And if you follow that through, you find that dropping the requirement that Greece run a primary surplus of 4.5 percent of GDP would allow spending to rise by 9 percent of GDP — twice as much — and that this would raise GDP by 12 percent relative to what it would have been otherwise."
937053134,yes,0.6547,"Let’s run with that, and create a crude adjusted measure of austerity."
937055321,yes,1,"Once interest rates on safe assets are zero or lower, however, liquidity has no opportunity cost; people will saturate themselves with it."
937052157,yes,0.6633,"The chart above has unemployment ex-stimulus peaking at 9 percent in the first quarter of 2010 and coming down through the year; the CBO estimates an average unemployment rate of 9 percent for 2010, so the Obama people are more optimistic than the CBO, and a lot more optimistic than I am."
937053094,yes,0.6818,"This bore on the question of whether exchange rate changes make adjustments in relative costs and prices easier; it bore more broadly on the question of whether prices are flexible, as fresh-water economists like to assume, or instead sticky in nominal terms."
937052152,yes,1,"So they say the plan would lower unemployment by about 2 percentage points, I said 1.7, but their estimate may actually be a bit more pessimistic than mine."
937053419,yes,0.6709,"Indeed, Hobijn and Daly suggest that there’s a “pent-up demand for wage cuts” that will probably push inflation lower even if the economy is recovering."
937056188,yes,1,"This is telling us that markets expect the euro area economy to be depressed, and ECB rates very low, for many years to come."
937052079,yes,1,"In any case, whatever happens will probably last quite a while."
937052744,yes,0.641,"Here’s what we agree on: if consumers have perfect foresight, live forever, have perfect access to capital markets, etc., then they will take into account the expected future burden of taxes to pay for government spending."
937052074,yes,0.6733,There’s a huge overhang of excess housing inventory; it will probably take several years before housing prices fall to realistic levels; and it’s not at all clear what will fill the gap left by weak housing and consumer spending.
937052505,yes,0.6353,"This relationship predicts falling inflation when the economy is depressed and the output gap is negative, rising inflation when the economy is overheating and the output gap is positive; this prediction works fairly well for modern US experience, explaining in particular the disinflation of the Volcker recession of the 1980s and the disinflation we’re experiencing now."
937054043,yes,1,"Ambrose Evans-Pritchard pushes back against my in-passing criticism of a column I mainly agree with, in which I argued that it’s hard to see why anyone believes that money supply increases will do the trick after the past six years."
937053060,yes,0.6715,"But even if you assume that the doctrine is right, it does NOT imply that government spending on, say, infrastructure will be met by offsetting declines in private spending."
937054013,yes,0.6336,"But we do need to remember that on the eve of the latest plunge real oil prices were very high by historical standards, so that oil imports as a share of GDP remained quite high — in fact, early OPEC high: So the economic impact might be bigger than you think."
937057116,yes,0.6308,And in that context more saving actually hurts the economy; it even hurts investment via the paradox of thrift.
937055727,yes,0.667,"After all, wasn’t everyone predicting lots of inflation?"
937056243,yes,1,"Meanwhile, German 10-year real interest rates are around -1, while U.S. real rates are slightly positive; this implies that markets expect the euro to recover only a third or so of its recent decline over the next decade."
937052455,yes,0.6417,So is there anything in the data suggesting that we need to invoke fear of government to explain low investment?
937056998,yes,0.6887,"On the other hand, that history is, I think, one factor behind a phenomenon we saw in 2008 and will see again this year: there’s a lot more passionate support for Clinton than either Sanders supporters or the news media imagine."
937054718,yes,0.6666,In the long run we are all dead.
937052521,yes,1,Third — and I fear that this is going to be a major issue in the future — it’s important to take account of downward rigidity so as not to get fooled into accepting a persistently depressed economy as normal.
937053911,yes,0.6654,"I posted about the surprisingly good news, at least so far, on Obamacare premiums for 2015 — and as usual was met with a wall of rage from the right."
937056979,yes,0.677,I don’t know what will happen in the caucuses tomorrow.
937053745,yes,0.6715,"But the crucial point, which he touches on only briefly at the end, is that whatever China’s motives, the Chinese wouldn’t hurt us if they dumped our bonds — in fact, it would probably be good for America."
937056392,yes,1,"So you would think that an agreement for Greece to run a modest primary surplus over the next few years would be easy to reach — that is what will happen, so why not make it official?"
937054747,yes,0.6889,"But a stronger dollar will make US goods less competitive, and act as a brake on further recovery."
937052340,yes,1,"Everything is different if the central bank is busy adjusting rates in response to conditions, and may well raise rates to offset the effects of any fiscal expansion."
937052205,yes,0.6739,In either case government borrowing for stimulus would have the effect of shifting the IS curve right.
937056514,yes,0.6554,Austerity for a country in Greece’s position appears to be an unworkable solution even if debt is all you care about.
937053521,yes,0.6598,Would there ever be final buyers for what all this capacity could produce?
937057325,yes,0.6732,"So let’s think of the choice being between Trump and Not-Trump, who is somewhat less awful but more likely to win in the general."
937053769,yes,0.651,"So here’s what I did: I took the implied 10-year breakeven inflation rate from US TIPS, minus the 10-year interest rate differential, plus the real appreciation Japan would experience if the real exchange rate against the dollar 10 years from now were to return to its level in January 2010."
937057418,yes,0.6667,The Republican nominee won’t.
937056246,yes,0.6818,"Bernanke seems to be saying that if there is a problem, it can be solved by cracking down on currency manipulation: [T]he US and the international community should continue to oppose national policies that promote large, persistent current account surpluses and to work toward an international system that delivers better balance in trade and capital flows."
937053315,yes,1,"Now we face a more severe slump, probably driven by deleveraging, in which even a zero rate isn’t low enough, so monetary policy has to work in unconventional ways – in particular, by changing expectations about future inflation, so as to reduce real interest rates."
937057208,yes,0.6807,"And the things the Fed is trying to do are in fact largely about compressing that spread, either by persuading investors that it will keep short rates at zero for a longer time or by going out and buying long-term assets."
937057010,yes,1,"In warning about Trumponomics, Romney declared If Donald Trump’s plans were ever implemented, the country would sink into prolonged recession."
937052415,yes,0.6718,"The thing which is most needed to secure healthy conditions is the most speedy and complete adaptation possible of the structure of production.If the proportion as determined by the voluntary decisions of individuals is distorted by the creation of artificial demand resources [are] again led into a wrong direction and a definite and lasting adjustment is again postponed.The only way permanently to ‘mobilise’ all available resources is, thereforeto leave it to time to effect a permanent cure by the slow process of adapting the structure of production."
937054173,yes,0.6712,The Fed should not be fighting against inflation until it sees the whites of its eyes.” And I mean exactly: Don’t tighten until you see the whites of inflation’s eyes — and at this point there is absolutely zero sign that inflation is nigh.
937052482,yes,0.6489,"And we would expect people to save much or most of such a tax cut — all of it, if you believe in full Ricardian equivalence."
937056864,yes,0.6493,"Jeb Bush is not going to be the Republican nominee, so it’s somewhat unfortunate that the invaluable Tax Policy Center chose to make his proposals the subject of its first analysis of candidate tax plans."
937056880,yes,0.6707,"But they failed to deliver the promised prosperity — and given the changes in the environment since then, any repeat of his push should seem unattractive."
937056800,yes,0.6818,What none of us thought about at the time was the further problem of the interaction of deflation and debt — the way attempts to adjust through falling wages would worsen debt problems.
937053904,yes,0.641,"And, of course, the better the deal the more people will sign up: success feeds success."
937052669,yes,0.6901,"The way this channel works in standard models, however, is that a rise in the real money supply reduces interest rates, leading to a rise in demand; and a fall in nominal wages for a given money supply would have the same effect."
937052564,yes,0.6653,"My opinion is that the demand, even though active and strong, will be met by supply which will be badly adjusted to fit it."
937053382,yes,1,"And, of course, this destructive behavior is especially likely if said country authorities are firm believers in the notion that austerity does not depress output; they’ll see the weak performance either as “structural” or as showing the need for more confidence."
937053751,yes,1,"It’s true that China could, possibly, depress the value of the dollar."
937053054,yes,0.6759,"It would be one thing if people like Cochrane had a serious critique of all this evidence, and of the decades-long research agenda that has confirmed the importance of price stickiness."
937053743,yes,0.6732,Matthew Yglesias notes an uptick in Very Serious People warning that China might lose confidence in America and start dumping our bonds.
937054010,yes,1,"I may be doing some media where people will ask me about what the oil plunge means for the US economy, so I thought I’d spend a bit of time figuring out what if anything I might say that’s interesting."
937056488,yes,0.6742,"The thing to understand, in any case, is that if Grexit does come, fiscal issues will immediately cease to be central to the story."
937056954,yes,0.6727,"And in both cases his positioning is disturbing — not just because it’s politically unrealistic to imagine that we can get the kind of radical overhaul he’s proposing, but also because he takes his own version of cheap shots."
937053642,yes,1,"But anyway, suppose the economy is depressed; this will lead to steadily falling inflation, which will lead the central bank to keep cutting interest rates (and because the inflation coefficient in Taylor rules is always bigger than one, this means cutting real rates); and eventually the interest rate will fall enough to restore full employment."
937052955,yes,0.6872,Suppose temporarily that the Fed holds the money supply fixed; in that case the interest rate must be such as to match that demand to the quantity of money.
937052364,yes,0.6698,"Suppose that I’m setting my price for the next year, and that I expect the overall level of prices — including things like the average price of competing goods — to rise 10 percent over the course of the year."
937053748,yes,1,"Think about it: China selling our bonds wouldn’t drive up short-term interest rates, which are set by the Fed."
937052180,yes,0.6687,"A capital inflow produces a trade deficit by causing the exchange rate to appreciate, the price level to rise, or some other change in the real economy that affects trade flows."
937053287,yes,1,"Unfortunately, between the GOP and the Very Serious People (who love, just love, the idea that it’s structural), it won’t happen any time soon."
937053731,yes,0.6889,"In that case monetary policy is initially tighter than the central bank would like, so that even if MP shifts left it won’t matter unless the shift is very large: My point is that what sounds like a straightforward claim – that loss of foreign confidence causes a contractionary rise in interest rates – just doesn’t come out of anything like a standard model."
937054312,yes,1,"Greece has been running a primary surplus since 2013, and according to its agreements with the troika it’s supposed to run a surplus of 4.5 percent of GDP for many years to come."
937057402,yes,0.676,But any responsible future president would have to think hard about such matters.
937053208,yes,1,"Obama will have a hard time taking their advice, however, given that he’s already proposed those very ideas."
937052440,yes,0.651,"Yes, maybe bond markets will punish us if we don’t slash spending right now; also, maybe we’ll have bad luck if we step on cracks, or fail to turn aside when Basement Cat crosses our path."
937053106,yes,0.6923,"We said that as long as the economy remained deeply depressed, even a huge rise in the monetary base would not be inflationary, and that even huge budget deficits would not send interest rates soaring."
937053694,yes,1,"In fact, it’s conceivable that things like rising fuel costs and automation (which makes labor costs less central) will lead to some “reshoring” of manufacturing to advanced countries, and a corresponding decline in the trade share."
937057275,yes,1,"Second, everyone acknowledges that the impact of a delayed sales tax increase on Japan’s debt would be trivial — less than one percent of GDP."
937055037,yes,1,"Suppose that Greece were to spend somewhat more than contemplated under the current agreement; the primary surplus would surely be less than would otherwise be the case, but the effect would be much less than one-for-one."
937052729,yes,0.6283,"Specifically, you’d expect any nominal shock to move the price level by the same amount that they move the exchange rate."
937052848,yes,1,"And this will be destructive; not only will output be below potential, but depressed incomes and deflation will make it harder for the Sams to pay down their debt."
937052438,yes,1,"And for that matter, a rise in inflation expectations would actually be a good thing right now, encouraging more spending — unless you believe that markets will someone react badly, for reasons not specified, to the Fed’s impaired “credibility” defined as … well, I’m not sure what."
937053921,yes,0.6657,Some experts claim that premiums will rise by double digits — big news!
937052565,yes,0.6696,"There may very well be a great shortage of labor of certain kinds, with no prospect of any shifting or adapting which will bring about an increased supply."
937053673,yes,0.6923,"He suggests that hidden protectionism may be partly to blame, and that this may have large economic costs."
937053454,yes,0.6537,"“These increased upside risks to inflation call for higher policy rates.” In fact, inflation is running below target just about everywhere."
937056682,yes,1,But even a quick glance at international balance of payments statistics shows you that countries whose currencies play no special role whatever are perfectly capable of running deficits over a long time; all that matters is that they be perceived as reliable debtors who offer good investment opportunities.
937056960,yes,0.6527,This lets Sanders claim that he could make it work with much lower middle-class taxes than would probably be needed in practice.
937057323,yes,1,"While Ted Cruz may insist that the liberal media are conspiring to choose Trump so they can blow him up later — it’s all tinfoil hats over there, folks — the truth is that Republican primary voters don’t watch John Oliver, and an endorsement from the NY Times is probably the kiss of death."
937054586,yes,0.6843,The EU could prevent that by deliberately undermining the post-euro Greek economy.
937052928,yes,0.6432,"The country doesn’t stay depressed forever: high unemployment leads to actual or at least relative deflation, which gradually improves cost-competitiveness, which leads to rising net exports and gradual expansion."
937052858,yes,1,"And he’ll also make it easier for the Sams to pay down their debt; if he keeps it up long enough, he can bring them to the point where they’re no longer so severely balance-sheet constrained, and further deficit spending is no longer required to achieve full employment."
937055865,yes,1,"Even huge increases in the monetary base won’t be inflationary – they shift MM to the right, but it makes no difference."
937052216,yes,1,"Assume that consumers want to reduce consumption by the same amount every year to offset this tax burden; then consumer spending will fall by $100 billion per year to compensate, wiping out any expansionary effect of the government spending."
937054439,yes,0.6537,"It would not mean demanding that creditors throw good money after bad; everyone has already implicitly acknowledged that the debt will never be fully paid at market rates, but Greece is making a transfer to its creditors by running a primary surplus, and we’re just arguing now about how big that transfer will be."
937057247,yes,0.6758,"Look, all we’re talking about is the rate of interest at which the economy would be more or less at full employment, which in turn implies that inflation will be more or less stable."
937052327,yes,1,"Many people on Wall Street are now warning that there’s a huge bubble in government debt, that interest rates will spike any day now; it’s a warning that clearly has the Obama administration’s ear."
937052483,yes,1,"In my simple 1998 model, there’s only one way the Fed can affect things at all: by promising, credibly, to print more money in the future, when the zero lower bound no longer binds."
937053258,yes,0.6852,"(my italics) On spending, they declared: That combination of other mandatory and discretionary spending was specified to decline from 12 percent of GDP in 2010 to about 6 percent in 2021 and then move in line with the GDP price deflator beginning in 2022, which would generate a further decline relative to GDP."
937055479,yes,0.6733,"And that’s a situation in which Europe’s weakness will be largely shared with the rest of the world — Europe will have its fall cushioned by trade surpluses, but the rest of us will be dragged down by the counterpart deficits."
937053786,yes,0.6497,"So international macro was probably going to stay relatively Keynesian, simply because the facts had such a well-known Keynesian bias."
937053383,yes,0.6689,"Either way, they’ll see it as a reason to tighten even more."
937053558,yes,1,"And, even if the absorption of the unemployed resources were to be quickened in this way, it would only mean that the seed would already be sown for new disturbances and new crises."
937052158,yes,0.6437,Bottom line: even if I use the Romer-Bernstein estimates instead of my own — there really isn’t much difference — this plan looks too weak.
937056498,yes,0.6731,This in turn means that you’d shrink the economy by around 3 percent.
937056618,yes,1,"For what it’s worth, I still don’t expect The Donald to win the nomination; the big money will presumably coalesce around someone — though given Jeb’s foot-in-mouth performance it’s hard to see who — and will probably squeeze him out in the end."
937054446,yes,1,"And if you follow that through, you find that dropping the requirement that Greece run a primary surplus of 4.5 percent of GDP would allow spending to rise by 9 percent of GDP — twice as much — and that this would raise GDP by 12 percent relative to what it would have been otherwise."
937056751,yes,1,"Some methods widely used to estimate potential output in effect assume that the economy has a strong tendency to return to full employment, so if we see a prolonged slump those methods rewrite history, concluding that the economy must have been badly overheated before the slump."
937053856,yes,0.6734,"What’s interesting now is that he freely admits that the Fed does, in fact, have multiple instruments with which to pull back liquidity and forestall inflation if recovery ever really comes."
937053285,yes,0.6345,"In the early stages of the Lesser Depression some data seemed to suggest a sharp rise in mismatch; it was left for us demand-siders to argue that this was actually a cyclical, not structural issue, and not fundamental to the employment problem."
937056172,yes,0.6469,German interest rates – presumably an indicator of perceived euro safe rates – are negative out to seven years; the 10-year rate is only 16 basis points.
937056982,yes,0.6737,"On the Democratic side, well, the last five polls all show Clinton in the lead, and FiveThirtyEight gives her an 80 percent chance of winning, but it’s not a sure thing."
937055001,yes,0.638,"Alexis Tsipras is not going to be on bank boards of directors, president of the BIS, or, probably, an EU commissioner."
937054168,yes,0.6803,"Among the Cambridge mafia, and in general among policy-oriented, more or less Keynesian types, there’s a surprisingly sharp divide over near-term US monetary policy."
937054897,yes,0.6865,"If you leave office held in high esteem by the Davos set, there are any number of European Commission or IMF or whatnot gigs that you might be eligible for even if you’re absolutely despised by your fellow countrymen."
937057273,yes,1,"First, unless Japan breaks out of deflation, and the artificially high real interest rates this causes, there is no way to achieve fiscal sustainability."
937052160,yes,0.6842,"First Eugene Fama, now John Cochrane, have made the claim that debt-financed government spending necessarily crowds out an equal amount of private spending, even if the economy is depressed — and they claim this not as an empirical result, not as the prediction of some model, but as the ineluctable implication of an accounting identity."
937056509,yes,0.6364,"And if you start with debt of 170 percent of GDP, this raises the debt ratio by more than a percentage point each year."
937056408,yes,0.6914,"And if the anti-establishment forces have a recovering Greece to point to, the discrediting of the establishment will accelerate."
937053955,yes,0.6417,"Third, there’s the standard textbook crowding out story, in which increased government spending in the face of a fixed money supply, or maybe a nominal income target, causes interest rates to rise and private investment to fall."
937057356,yes,0.6834,"Protectionism can do real harm, making economies less efficient and reducing long-run growth."
937052857,yes,1,"The true social cost of these things will be very low, because he’ll be putting resources that would otherwise be unemployed to work."
937054317,yes,0.6666,"Remember, the main reason austerity has been so harsh is that cutting spending leads to economic contraction, which leads to lower revenues, which forces further cuts to hit the budget target."
937053320,yes,1,Probably they imagine that once the election is past sensible economics will return.
937053560,yes,0.6295,"(10) And so, at the end of our analysis, we arrive at results which only confirm the old truth that we may perhaps prevent a crisis by checking expansion in time, but that we can do nothing to get out of it before its natural end, once it has come."
937052525,yes,1,"After all, all indications are that we’re going to be dealing with a depressed economy for a long time to come."
937057290,yes,0.674,"As it happens, I don’t think this stuff will come into play in Japan, where the Ministry of Finance’s deficit obsession ensures that tax hikes will at best be delayed, not canceled."
937056288,yes,0.6747,"It’s less clear, I’d say, that health care will be a big driver, since the rate of growth of health spending seems to have slowed."
937053398,yes,0.6565,Those savings and investment curves are what the supply and demand for funds would be if the economy were at full employment.
937056483,yes,1,"Then Greece’s fiscal problems would melt away, with no need for further cuts."
937054601,yes,0.6789,Ordinarily we would expect unit labor costs — the labor cost of producing a fixed amount of output — to rise more or less at the overall rate of inflation.
937054741,yes,1,"Moving from a very limited financial system that doesn’t allow much debt to a somewhat more open-minded system should, in that case, be good for growth and welfare."
937056278,yes,0.6878,"He also suggests — or at least that’s how I read him — the common thread among these activities that makes the government a better provider than the market; namely, they all involve individuals making very-long-term decisions."
937054289,yes,1,"I’m very worried that the Fed may be gearing up to raise rates too soon; he’s sanguine, considering the risk of a Japan-type trap in the US minimal and the case for a rate hike this year solid."
937053365,yes,0.6676,Not a good omen for Europe.
937052726,yes,0.702,"So suppose that there were a doubling of prices in America while inflation remained at zero in Europe, but that the dollar lost half its value against the euro."
937056353,yes,0.678,"I’ve also put in the closest growth number I could get to the one Bartels uses for the US, taken from the ONS."
937054892,yes,0.6697,"Partly also, I suspect, because creditors have come to expect the symbolism of debtor governments abjectly abandoning their campaign promises in the name of responsibility, and are waiting for the new Greek government to pay the usual tribute of humiliation."
937052746,yes,0.6582,"Assume that consumers want to reduce consumption by the same amount every year to offset this tax burden; then consumer spending will fall by $100 billion per year to compensate, wiping out any expansionary effect of the government spending."
937053724,yes,0.682,Now suppose that investors turn on your country for some reason.
937053223,yes,0.6785,The path rises steadily from about 15 percent of GDP in 2010 to 19 percent in 2028 and remains at that level thereafter.
937057127,no,1,"It gives some of those excess savings a place to go — and in the process expands overall demand, and hence GDP."
937052867,no,0.6574,"For the past year or so, however, Pimco seems to me to have been making less and less sense."
937054731,no,1,"As Ezra Klein noted, reporters didn’t treat him as an ordinary public figure, but rather as the voice of obvious responsibility, on whose behalf the ordinary rules of press neutrality didn’t apply."
937057379,no,1,So there you have it.
937054722,no,1,"Yes, good macro tends to be simple, at least conceptually; but simple and simplistic aren’t the same thing, and by and large people who solemnly declared that things are more complicated than that ended up with lots of egg on their faces."
937052558,no,1,The best line I’ve ever heard about Ayn Rand’s influence: There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old’s life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged.
937053575,no,1,"Nonetheless, a huge increase in the monetary base just sat there, mostly in the form of increased bank reserves – the same as what happened in America later."
937056470,no,1,So it seems to me that for now I should hold back a bit.
937052985,no,1,"Look at the June 2010 monthly report of the ECB (pdf), specifically the discussion of “fiscal consolidation” on page 83 and following."
937056819,no,1,"So, deja vu all over again, all over again."
937052828,no,1,What’s wrong with that argument?
937052797,no,1,"This view could be wrong, or at least incomplete."
937053923,no,1,The result is that most news consumers — who form impressions rather than trying to work out details — have the sense that it’s been all bad news.
937052213,no,1,So let me try this one more time.
937053848,no,1,"But of course it wasn’t the interest on reserves, as both the 30s case and Japan show."
937052358,no,0.673,"Core inflation isn’t supposed to measure the cost of living, it’s supposed to measure something else: inflation inertia."
937052933,no,0.6603,And that isn’t happening.
937055596,no,0.6632,"Comparative advantage was an early, classic example of how economic reasoning can lead to results that are true but not obvious; naturally, economists have always wanted this intellectual victory to be important in the real world too."
937055156,no,1,"The Wall Street Journal, similarly, could have attracted someone much less likely to trip over his own intellectual shoelaces."
937053641,no,1,"This is an equilibrating system — I’m not sure if it’s exactly self-equilibrating, because part of the mechanism runs through the mind of the central bank."
937054140,no,1,"Modern conservatism doesn’t have Friedman-like figures — people who would be prominent economists thanks to their research whatever their politics, who are also public intellectuals– because it doesn’t want them."
937055894,no,1,"I’ve been following San Fermin for a while, and they had a slot from 10 to 10:40 — which was nearly sabotaged by technical problems."
937053003,no,1,"And we understand — or used to understand — how the Depression happened, and what to do in such a situation."
937057373,no,0.6493,"It’s a real problem; U.S. economic fundamentals are fairly strong, but we risk, in effect, importing economic weakness from the rest of the world."
937057392,no,1,"When I say that Republicans have been more protectionist than Democrats, I’m not talking about the distant past, about the high-tariff policies of the Gilded Age; I’m talking about modern Republican presidents, like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush."
937052105,no,1,"We replaced the old, bank-centered system with a high-tech gizmo that was supposed to be more efficient — but it relied on fancy computer chips to function, and it turns out that there were some fatal errors in the programming."
937054131,no,1,"But we really, really don’t know what unemployment rate corresponds to “full employment”."
937057249,no,0.6443,And to raise the old “equilibrium interest rates must be positive because capital is productive” line at this point — after two decades of Japanese experience and 7 years at the zero lower bound here in America — suggests a strange sort of out-of-touchness.
937053281,no,1,"On the other side you have either supply-side views a la Mulligan claiming that taxes and benefits are discouraging people from working, or more or less Austrianish views that it’s about maladaption of the structure of production that left too many workers and too much capital stuck in the wrong industries."
937055621,no,1,"You might try to argue that there is a US interest in enhancing IP protection even if it’s not good for the world, because in many cases it’s US corporations with the property rights."
937057005,no,1,So here we go.
937056567,no,1,And the outcomes were well within a range consistent with the previous austerity-growth relationship.
937052927,no,1,"Look, standard Keynesian models, open-economy version, tell a very clear story about what happens when a country pegs its exchange rate at a level that leaves its industry uncompetitive."
937054167,no,1,And when I look around I realize that our disagreement over coffee is part of a wider split.
937052755,no,1,A few thoughts.
937052495,no,0.6718,"The zero lower bound on short rates really does matter, even if longer-term rates are positive."
937053211,no,1,A number of commenters have asked for a summary of what’s actually in the Ryan plan.
937053834,no,1,"Sometimes jargon is good, too."
937052589,no,1,The answer is a fall in interest rates.
937056034,no,1,Start with Bernanke’s critique of Summers.
937056790,no,1,"But the real losers here are the reporters and centrist pundits who let themselves be played, month after month, by Trey Gowdy and company."
937056882,no,1,"Inequality is a big issue, too, in a way it wasn’t at the end of the Clinton boom."
937056520,no,1,But their analyses ring truer than ever.
937052957,no,1,"Here too, however, GDP must be taken into account: a higher level of GDP will mean more transactions, and hence higher demand for money, other things equal."
937052742,no,1,Let me repost most of it: It’s one thing to have an argument about whether consumers are perfectly rational and have perfect access to the capital markets; it’s another to have the big advocates of all that perfection not understand the implications of their own model.
937052431,no,1,"The point here is that Warsh’s argument basically rests on assertions not about what markets are saying now, but about presumed market reactions to policy."
937056923,no,0.6925,"Since 2010, however, fiscal policy has been paralyzed by GOP obstruction, so we’re back to a situation where the WH has little influence."
937053198,no,1,"But rather than questioning its premises, that side of the field essentially turned its back on evidence, calibrating its models rather than testing them, and refusing even to teach alternative views."
937052242,no,1,"The answer is that you need to add “liquidity preference”, the supply and demand for money."
937057414,no,1,"And the rest of the answer is that Denmark (and, to a lesser extent, Canada) has a much stronger social safety net than we do. "
937052572,no,1,"One of the common arguments against fiscal policy in the current situation – one that sounds sensible – is that debt is the problem, so how can debt be the solution?"
937056795,no,1,"But I never believed this would work, and based my skepticism on some real evidence."
937056753,no,1,"The US wasn’t experiencing accelerating inflation at an unemployment rate around 5 percent in the mid-2000s; it’s not seeing accelerating inflation now, with unemployment back to the same vicinity."
937057232,no,1,"His economics is all wrong, which is the main thing; but it’s also worth noting that thee and a half years ago Romney himself argued for exactly the same policies Trump advocates now, blithely dismissing the dangers: “I’ve watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency,” Mr. Romney said."
937052863,no,1,"It was a striking experience, sartorially: I showed up in Newport Beach in my gray business suit, and they were all in casual shirts and slacks, some (as I remember it) with fashionable stubble."
937054115,no,1,"Well, here’s a quick and easy picture."
937054881,no,1,"Maybe, but my guess is that there was nothing they could do to avoid a bitter confrontation short of immediate betrayal of the voters who put them in office."
937057003,no,1,Both had 80 percent approval among Democrats in the DMR poll released yesterday.
937053840,no,1,Gosh.
937052109,no,1,“Homebuilders led the stock parade this week with a fantastic 11 percent gain.
937053045,no,1,"What Matt may not know, however, is that this is a classic argument in international macro, and the person who made it best was …."
937056446,no,1,Jeb Bush!
937057170,no,0.6526,"But what I found striking was Hiatt’s offhand explanation of why his never-changing, never-right prediction keeps not happening; it’s because the Federal Reserve is gobbling up U.S. debt to keep interest rates low Clearly, this has become part of the CW."
937052992,no,1,"And now they’re shocked, shocked that the Greek economy is plunging into a hole."
937057136,no,1,"This is utterly wrong, and in fact Gross’s own mistakes show that it’s wrong: one of his big failures was betting that rates would spike when the Fed ended QE2, which they predictably didn’t."
937053736,no,1,"Yes, this is “printing money” – but when you’re in a liquidity trap, that doesn’t matter."
937054082,no,1,What makes this belief curious is that it’s the exact opposite of the truth.
937052625,no,1,Awesome.
937053460,no,0.6689,"In other words, they fear that a successful stimulus would be wasting a good crisis."
937052446,no,1,"Instead, Iceland devalued its currency massively and imposed capital controls."
937056342,no,0.6733,In fact — and I wish both Yates and Bernanke were clearer about this — Taylor’s central claim about the alleged errors of monetary policy is bizarre.
937054727,no,1,"Finally, I know that people who airily dismiss the austerity debate and all that and demand that we focus on the long run think they’re taking a brave stand; but you know, they aren’t."
937057193,no,1,"I mean, where are the editorials in the WSJ demanding that the Fed raise its inflation target?"
937056166,no,0.6914,"but not too far off — despite being at the zero lower bound for many years, Japan ended up offering more or less competitive real returns."
937056528,no,1,And maybe we should.
937052252,no,1,So what does government borrowing do?
937052907,no,1,"All they’ve actually done, of course, is rehash their prejudices."
937052184,no,1,"Here’s the diagram: In this picture savings plus taxes equal investment plus government spending, the accounting identity that both Fama and Cochrane think vitiates fiscal policy — but it doesn’t."
937056539,no,1,The relevance to Greece seems obvious.
937053544,no,1,"In short, the data strongly point toward a cyclical, not a structural story — and there is broad agreement, for once, among economists on this point."
937053907,no,0.6481,"Are they, maybe, considering the possibility that they’re listening to the wrong people, that maybe Jon Gruber knows what he’s talking about and John Goodman is a hack?"
937056739,no,1,"In its 2011 report, in fact, it declared that Highly accommodative monetary policies are fast becoming a threat to price stability."
937057128,no,1,"It does NOT crowd out private spending, at least not until the excess supply of savings has been sopped up, which is the same thing as saying not until the economy has escaped from the liquidity trap."
937054146,no,1,And here are mine.
937056903,no,1,What’s wrong with this?
937054864,no,1,So what happens?
937053668,no,1,I’m still working on this.
937056902,no,0.6651,"Thus, I’d argue that the growth-based agenda should focus on a different list of issues: expanding education and training; expanding research and development spending; tax and regulatory reform; expanding international trade; and investments in energy and infrastructure."
937053483,no,0.6571,A much stronger expansion in the euro area as a whole; higher inflation in the European core.
937056849,no,1,"Still, that remains a live argument."
937054865,no,1,"Our currency rises, which causes a larger trade deficit; demand for domestic goods falls, while demand abroad rises, reducing the gap in interest rates."
937052963,no,1,"And it also gets you past confusions like the notion that government deficits, by driving up interest rates, can actually cause the economy to contract."
937052966,no,0.6452,"Because if the interest rate fell below zero, people would just hold cash instead of bonds."
937052077,no,1,"The 1990-91 recession was brought on by a credit crunch, the 2001 recession by overinvestment; this time we’ve got both."
937056558,no,0.6699,"Exhibit 1 shows the overall stance of fiscal policy in the GIIPS, using the IMF’s estimate of the structural budget balance as a share of potential GDP — an imperfect measure, but good enough, I think, to make the point."
937052592,no,1,Then we have a problem.
937052912,no,0.6715,"Or it might be the paradox of flexibility, which says that under current conditions a fall in wages would lead to lower,not higher employment and output."
937053547,no,1,"Still thinking about the Bloomberg Businessweek interview with Rand Paul, in which he nominated Milton Friedman’s corpse for Fed chairman."
937054088,no,1,"Using that approach, they laid out at some length various scenarios for a strategy of reducing the rate of money growth, and hence eventually reducing inflation."
937057387,no,0.6688,"What’s more, the positions of the parties will be the reverse of what you might have expected: Republicans, who claim to stand for free markets, are likely to nominate a crude protectionist, leaving Democrats, with their skepticism about untrammeled markets, as the de facto defenders of relatively open trade."
937053251,no,1,"And in particular, they haven’t grasped how Ryan has gamed the system."
937056715,no,1,And the trouble is that it’s not at all clear where these interests lie.
937053517,no,1,"And, above all, the fact that for many years this guy was regarded as the Maestro, a man of almost supernatural wisdom and judgment."
937056451,no,1,"is running on his economic record as governor of Florida, on the claim that he knows how to create growth — 4 percent growth, no less — because of the way Florida prospered during his term in office: We made Florida number one in job creation and number one in small business creation."
937057075,no,1,The case for raising the target — which means not raising rates if and when inflation finally creeps up to 2 percent — just keeps getting stronger.
937054302,no,1,"On the whole, it seems less likely for the outsiders, although it’s true that the Keynesian econoblogs form what amounts to a tight ongoing discussion group that could be doing some amplification of its own: But if you ask me, there’s a worrying complacency among the insiders right now, and I would urge them to consider the potential consequences if they’re wrong."
937055021,no,1,"Rand Paul by no means has a monopoly on monetary crazy, conspiracy theories very much included."
937055038,no,1,We can summarize the actual effect of higher government spending (ΔG) on the primary surplus (ΔPS) as follows: ΔPS = -ΔG*(1-μτ) where μ is the multiplier and τ is the marginal effect of a one-euro rise in GDP on revenues and/or cyclically linked spending like unemployment benefits.
937053472,no,1,"So one way to see the drive for austerity is as an application of a sort of reverse Hippocratic oath: “First, do nothing to mitigate harm”."
937052576,no,1,"Yet that can’t be right; if it were, we wouldn’t have a problem in the first place."
937053912,no,1,The idea that this thing might be working inspires a level of anger nothing else (except maybe climate science) matches.
937054077,no,1,Bush the other didn’t cause that bubble — but all his alleged success involved taking a ride on it.
937052405,no,1,"He suggests that it reflects a general distaste for anything that looks like government intervention to support the economy: I think the thinking of the libertarians and freshwater believers is that if there’s a recession, then the free market has a good reason for it."
937056385,no,1,Are there times when monetary policy — or at least conventional monetary policy — can’t do the job?
937057319,no,1,I don’t see any method at all.
937053538,no,1,Neither industrial nor demographic shifts nor a mismatch of skills with job vacancies is behind the increased rates of unemployment.
937052265,no,1,"First, Japan: Next, America in the 30s: Notice, in this case, that a Friedman-style focus on a broad monetary aggregate gives the false impression that Fed policy wasn’t very expansionary."
937054160,no,1,"More broadly, many of the people who either make monetary policy or comment on it from fairly influential perches are members of what you might call the 1970s Cambridge mafia."
937054433,no,1,In a sense the debt is an accounting fiction; it’s whatever the governments trying to dictate terms to Greece decide to say it is.
937054745,no,1,"The rhetoric of fiscal debates has been, for the most part, nonsense."
937053114,no,1,Hints of recovery in Ireland (which proved a false dawn)?
937057030,no,1,There was so much wrong with Mitt Romney’s Trump-is-a-disaster-whom-I-will-support-in-the-general speech that it may seem odd to call him out for bad international macroeconomics.
937053157,no,1,"Oh, and we should also add both FDIC costs and Fannie/Freddie losses in Florida."
937056878,no,1,"Take, for example, tax policy."
937057024,no,1,There’s no evidence at all that it did.
937057177,no,1,"But finally and most importantly, since when do we believe that central banks can hold interest rates down at will, for extended periods, without consequences?"
937056875,no,1,"As I’ve said, it’s hard these days for liberals to look at the state of the Republican primary without feeling a lot of Trumpenfreude."
937053051,no,0.7028,"What you see here is that despite crushing unemployment, wages in Ireland and Latvia have come down only slightly — but Iceland, by letting its currency devalue, achieved a quick 30 percent fall in wages relative to the euro zone."
937056534,no,1,"As you can see from the chart, Argentina’s economy was in free fall over the course of 2001 — before the dollar peg was abandoned — thanks in large part to banking collapse and public panic (sound familiar?)."

937053776,no,0.6746,"I was a student at MIT at the time, and remember Stan assigning papers on long-term contracts, which he viewed as one possible way to think about the sources of nominal price and wage stickiness – which he obviously considered both a clear fact about the world and important."

937053708,no,0.6948,"Still, let me ignore that, and plug Subramanian’s numbers into the equation above; I get a 4.9 percent rise in real incomes due to increased globalization."
937053284,no,1,I was especially struck by his data on “mismatch” (which everyone I know calls mishmash): the extent to which there appears to be a misalignment between where the workers are and where the jobs are.
937056837,no,1,"The other big problem is the dramatic drop in estimates of potential output, which is clearly correlated with the depth of cyclical slumps — and with austerity policies."
937053839,no,1,And Larry White then adds that it was all sterilized because the Fed paid a whopping 0.25 percent interest rate on reserves.
937054287,no,1,Which brings me to the point.
937053623,no,1,"So, think about macro as David Romer presented it back in 2000 (pdf)."

937053853,no,0.6693,Martin Feldstein warns us that the Fed isn’t taking the risk of rapidly rising inflation seriously enough.
937053820,no,0.6405,"If I talk about Dixit-Stiglitz preferences, or for that matter the zero lower bound, technically trained economists immediately know whereof I speak, where plain English would both take longer and leave room for misunderstanding."
937053778,no,1,So why was Stan not willing to go with the seemingly triumphant paradigm?
937056597,no,0.7099,"Anyway, on to the point."
937054075,no,1,"Actually, this would have been silly even if Florida had a well-founded boom — governors don’t matter that much."
937052719,no,1,So the big drop there isn’t entirely about deflation fears.
937056624,no,1,"PR replies that Lucas once was like that, but no longer, and asks what happened."
937053186,no,1,What’s the evidence that Keynesians respond to evidence?
937056273,no,1,"National defense, weather satellites, disease control, etc.. And in the 19th century that was arguably what governments mainly did."
937053799,no,1,"And at MIT, where Rudi’s influence was strong, it meant that even those in domestic macro, like Olivier Blanchard – and Stan Fischer – retained a skeptical attitude toward the neoclassical takeover."
937057216,no,1,"He or she may get some interest income from bank deposits, but not much: ordinary Americans have fewer financial assets than the elite can easily imagine.And as for pensions: yes, some people have defined-benefit pension plans that aren’t indexed for inflation."
937054055,no,1,"If the short-term interest rate is currently zero, changing the current money supply without changing future supplies — and hence raising expected inflation — matters not at all."
937055330,no,1,So what should the Fed do?
937055473,no,0.6781,"In an idealized world permanent shocks should be fully shared — that is, permanently weak demand in Europe should hurt the United States just as much as it does Europe."
937053707,no,0.657,"There are some conceptual difficulties with using this rise directly in the Eaton-Kortum framework, because much of it has taken the form of trade in intermediate goods, and the framework isn’t designed to handle that."
937052336,no,0.6634,But the character of housing demand makes the much-feared decline in prices on a nationwide basis unlikely … Hmmm.
937056972,no,1,"It’s a bit more shocking to see Mike Konczal — one of our most powerful advocates of financial reform, heroic critic of austerity, and a huge resource for progressives — attacked as one of Hillary’s minions and an ally of the financial industry."
937057199,no,1,And you do in fact see assertions to that effect all the time.
937052375,no,1,"So we need a measure that extracts the signal from the noise, getting at the inertial part of the story."
937053618,no,1,"They’re very much exceptional, applying only when interest rates are up against the zero lower bound."
937056598,no,1,"What I would argue is key to this situation — and, in particular, key to understanding how the conventional wisdom on Trump/McCain went so wrong — is the reality that a lot of people are, in effect, members of a delusional cult that is impervious to logic and evidence, and has lost touch with reality."
937052671,no,0.6549,"Well, the answer in a simple model is that falling wages and prices can still be expansionary, but only because they reduce current prices relative to expected future prices, and thereby generate expected inflation."

937057049,no,1,(Trade actually fell faster during the early stages of the 2008 Great Recession than it did after 1929.)
937052673,no,1,"So does this mean that wage stickiness is irrelevant to the situation, that we’d be experiencing the same slump if wages were perfectly flexible?"
937055149,no,1,That is indeed part of the story about that Moore op-ed.
937056898,no,0.6672,"Well, yes — because these are important debates, and refusing to take sides is a dereliction of responsibility."
937052859,no,0.6533,"Yes, private debt will in part have been replaced by public debt – but the point is that debt will have been shifted away from severely balance-sheet-constrained players, so that the economy’s problems will have been reduced even if the overall level of debt hasn’t fallen."
937053205,no,1,"I’ve written before that “fanatical centrist” is not an oxymoron; in fact, it’s a type that makes up a large part of our pundit class — people so wedded to their self-image as centrists standing between the extremes of the two parties that they cannot bring themselves to acknowledge that one party already advocates all that they are calling for."
937053456,no,1,But no.
937057089,no,1,"Why would a reporter credit the Fed’s critics with warnings they didn’t give, and fail to mention what they actually said?"
937052783,no,1,"But this does bring back memories: during the Social Security debate, Cato tried to expunge all evidence that it had ever used the word “privatization”, when it was easy to show that its project was originally the Project on Social Security Privatization."

937053441,no,1,"We had a huge financial crisis, and the combination of a housing bust (on both sides of the Atlantic) and an overhang of household debt (also on both sides) has acted as a drag on private demand."

937054711,no,1,"Rattner dismisses the austerity/stimulus debate as “simplistic”; Jeff Sachs calls Keynesian concerns “crude”; many, many people (I’d guess an especially large fraction of those at Davos) are eager to get away from all this deflation stuff and talk about how what they imagine to be, or wish were, the really important issues like Big Data and a world that’s even flatter."

937054455,no,1,"So, some points about where things stand: 1."
937057179,no,1,Or think of it in terms of the original Wicksellian concept of the natural rate of interest (pdf).

937052086,no,1,Update: Ezra Klein adds a screenshot of the original Harry and Louise ad — they’ve obviously deliberately copied it.
937055148,no,0.67,"When none of these things happened, when the law’s first year of full operation went better than even supporters had expected, the reaction was, I believe, something new in American politics: right-wingers simply acted as if their predictions had come true, as if all the imagined disasters were actual truths on the ground."
937056320,no,1,What needed correcting?
937056524,no,1,"The bizarreness of the whole thing is how flaky, speculative ideas like expansionary austerity became orthodoxy, while applying the economics of Fisher and Friedman became heterodoxy bordering on Chavismo."
937053996,no,1,Why?
937053488,no,1,But the important thing now is to change the policies that are creating this nightmare.
937052714,no,1,"One is that Figure 1, cited in the paper, isn’t, you know, actually there."
937053729,no,1,"We could modify this conclusion if the central bank is worried about the inflationary effect of depreciation, so that MP shifts left."
937053540,no,1,The patterns observed are consistent with unemployment being caused by cyclic phenomena that are more pronounced during the current recession than in prior recessions.
937052764,no,1,"Not this time, however, since housing is deeply depressed and there’s a huge overhang of excess capacity."
937053237,no,1,Dave Weigel made a great catch the other day: he notes that Paul Ryan has said that his views on monetary policy are based on Francisco d’Anconia’s speech in Atlas Shrugged.
937054104,no,1,"Or, maybe not."
937052262,no,1,"Let me add, for the 1.6 trillionth time, we are in a liquidity trap."
937057125,no,1,"When central banks have pushed policy rates as low as they can, and the economy is still depressed, what that tells you is that the economy is awash in excess desired savings that have nowhere to go."
937056525,no,1,"If Grexit happens, then what?"
937052318,no,1,"It would basically be saying not that the government is borrowing too much, but that the people conveying funds from savers, who want short-term assets, to the government, which borrows long, are undercapitalized."
937052239,no,1,"What you’re supposed to understand, however, is that the derivation I’ve just given is just a different way of arriving at the same result."
937056833,no,1,"Specifically, we used to cite the “clockwise spirals” one saw in unemployment-inflation space as evidence for something like the Friedman-Phelps theory of the natural rate."
937057111,no,1,"First, the image of the little old lady living hand to mouth off the interest on her bank account is basically a fiction."

937053413,no,1,Why?
937056579,no,1,affinity fraud.
937052606,no,1,"The bottom line, then, is that the plausible-sounding argument that debt can’t cure debt is just wrong."
937056826,no,1,"There’s a whole industry of people trying to show that Keynesian predictions about austerity didn’t pan out; it’s an industry that relies mainly on crude misrepresentations of what those predictions really amount to, and especially on confusions between levels and rates of change."
937053455,no,1,You might therefore think that the BIS would step back a bit and reconsider both its policy recommendations and the framework it uses to derive those recommendations.
937056005,no,1,"I’ve taken the NOAA data and divided states into three groups by average temperature: Group I is colder than Rhode Island, Group III warmer than California: Who’s in Group III?"

937052978,no,1,"As Weisenthal points out, however, Gross’s exaggerated fear of deficits was very widespread; it was, indeed, what all the Very Serious People were obsessing about, even as the real economy was falling apart."
937052081,no,1,The Obama campaign sends out an ugly mailer.
937052447,no,1,"And a strange thing has happened: although Iceland is generally considered to have experienced the worst financial crisis in history, its punishment has actually been substantially less than that of other nations."
937053125,no,1,"But when prices that matter to them — say, interest rates — fall, it’s an outrage."
937052842,no,1,What would give them an incentive to do this?
937053709,no,0.6807,"That’s by no means small change, but it’s only a fairly small fraction of global growth."
937053913,no,1,No news there.
937056693,no,1,"Instead, I feel an even deeper sense of despair — because people are still rolling out those same fallacies, even though in the interim those of us who remembered and understood Keynes/Hicks have been right about most things, and those lecturing us have been wrong about everything."
937054034,no,1,"Obviously the plunge in oil prices is the big driver, but the ruble has actually fallen more than Brent — oil is down 40 percent since the start of the year, but the ruble is down by half."
937056931,no,1,But the Sanders plan in a way reinforces my point that calls for single-payer in America at this point are basically a distraction.
937053215,no,1,"So, what’s in the plan?"
937053696,no,1,We should be neither amazed nor disturbed if it stops happening.
937053632,no,0.6844,"So here’s what happens after a large negative shock to the economy: the central bank finds itself up against the zero lower bound, so that all it can do is resort to controversial unorthodox measures."
937055173,no,1,"When a politician like Scott Walker tries to appeal to the conservative macro brains trust, it’s not some version of the Chicago Boys — it’s Stephen Moore, Art Laffer, and Larry Kudlow."

937056332,no,1,"Taylor has been harshly critical of the Fed, which he claims caused the financial crisis by failing to pursue his policy rule from the early 1990s precisely; Ben Bernanke, now that he’s free to speak his mind, has responded by firmly smacking Taylor upside the head."

937056644,no,1,And here is where the kind of willful obscurantism Romer is after became the norm.
937056626,no,1,"First of all, it’s true about the initial transparency."
937053851,no,1,Yet the reaction of those who wrongly predicted runaway inflation is to assert that (a) nobody could have predicted (even though some us did) and (b) it’s just special circumstances.
937054161,no,1,"Olivier, Ben Bernanke, Ken Rogoff, Mario Draghi, and yours truly all overlapped at MIT in the mid-70s; Larry Summers was at Harvard at the same time, taking courses at MIT; just about everyone was Stan Fischer’s student."
937056317,no,1,Remarkable stuff.
937055448,no,1,"That was, if you check the date, six years ago."
937056596,no,1,Oh well.
937056411,no,1,"So think about it, IFKATs: are you really sure you want to start going down this road?"
937053213,no,1,"The first thing you should know is that there are a couple of vintages of the plan, with some changes in detail, but not in general thrust."
937057321,no,1,Should progressives fear a Trump nomination or cheer it on?
937056904,no,1,Let me count the ways.
937053884,no,1,"This was very much a vindication of more or less Keynesian views about the economy, and the 80s were in fact marked by the New Keynesian comeback."
937056250,no,1,"Sad news: Jose da Silva Lopes, a Portuguese economist and government official who played a crucial role shepherding his country into the community of democratic Europe, has just died."

937054081,no,1,"One of those beliefs is that the experience of disinflation in the 1980s was a huge shock to Keynesians, refuting everything they believed."
937053629,no,1,Two ugly zeroes.
937057021,no,1,But that’s not at all the same as saying that it causes recessions.
937056262,no,0.6761,"As regular readers may have noticed, Brad and I share many views, so I expected something along lines I have also been thinking."
937053730,no,0.6454,"In this case we could, possibly, have a contractionary effect of lost investor confidence – but the channel runs through the inflation fears of the central bank, which doesn’t seem to be at all what Rogoff or others are talking about: Furthermore, suppose that we start in a liquidity trap."
937052373,no,0.6506,"Now, the measurement issue: we’d like to keep track of this sort of inflation inertia, both on the upside and on the downside — because just as embedded inflation is hard to get rid of, so is embedded deflation (ask the Japanese)."
937054303,no,0.6645,How should we think about the bargaining that may or may not now take place between the new Greek government and the troika?
937057152,no,1,The question is what you think about this situation.
937052734,no,1,"You can see that in the figure above; here’s one of Mussa’s figures, which highlights it even better because it covers a shorter period of floating rates: You can, if you’re desperate, try to explain this away by saying that there was some fundamental structural change in the early 1970s, but at that point you’re deep into epicycle territory."
937053352,no,1,But none of this is right.
937052141,no,1,"The plan limits the rise in unemployment, but things are still pretty bad, with the rate peaking at something like 9 percent and coming down only slowly."
937052523,no,1,"Many economists might look at that situation and say, well, deflation is stable, not accelerating, so we must be at the natural rate of unemployment — move along, folks, nothing to see here."
937052832,no,1,"Ignoring the foreign component, or looking at the world as a whole, the overall level of debt makes no difference to aggregate net worth – one person’s liability is another person’s asset."

937054869,no,1,"If expected returns at home and abroad must be equal, and interest rates are zero both at home and abroad, the current exchange rate must equal the expected future exchange rate, which as we’ve seen is tied down by the requirement that the interest rates consistent with full employment be equalized."
937052271,no,1,"The point is that finance is deeply interconnected, so that even a moderately large player can take down the system if it implodes."
937053088,no,1,"And even so, its reaction involves very little offset to the initial spending."
937056607,no,1,"On one side, they can’t admit the moderation of the Democrats, which is why you had the spectacle of demands that Obama change course and support his own policies."
937053449,no,1,"Rather, he’s the mouthpiece for a global college of central bankers, almost all of whom find themselves under intense pressure from their national governments to keep things ticking over while they try to repair the economy."
937056639,no,1,"But Lucas and his school couldn’t do that, because they had burned their bridges."
937056926,no,0.6545,Financial reform was similarly supposed to be hugely destructive.
937056620,no,1,"Paul Romer has been writing a series of posts on the problem he calls “mathiness”, in which economists write down fairly hard-to-understand mathematical models accompanied by verbal claims that don’t actually match what’s going on in the math."
937052378,no,1,Of course not — and standard core measures have been behaving a bit erratically lately.
937053078,no,1,Maybe there is some multiplier out there that we could measure well but that’s not what that paper does.
937057364,no,1,"No, it didn’t — protectionism was a result of the Depression, not its cause."
937056941,no,1,And Sanders isn’t coming clean on that — he’s promising Medicaid-like costs while also promising no rationing.
937056329,no,0.708,"So we’re all monsters, however nice we may seem in person."
937056267,no,1,In this post I consider only the first point.

937052694,no,1,"In scenario B, we have 4 percent German inflation and zero Spanish inflation, implying eurozone inflation of 3 percent."
937052685,no,0.6883,"So, imagine a eurozone that contains only two countries, Germany and Spain."
937053782,no,0.6616,"Exchange rates behave like asset prices, swinging wildly year to year; goods prices move much less, which means that the real exchange rate – the relative price of two currencies, deflated by the ratio of price levels in the two countries, fluctuates wildly too."
937053453,no,1,"Except that a couple of years back it was telling a completely different story about why we needed to raise rates; you see, the big danger was of imminent inflation: “Global inflation pressures are rising rapidly as commodity prices soar and as the global recovery runs into capacity constraints,” said the BIS, which acts as a central bank for the world’s central banks."
937052087,no,1,"Just to remind everyone, Harry and Louise were the center of the vile smear campaign the insurance lobby waged against health care reform in 1993 — and this time a Democratic candidate is doing the smearing for them."
937056428,no,1,But it’s all about the euro straitjacket.
937052683,no,1,Jean-Claude Trichet is sounding hawkish about inflation again — and this is very bad news for the European periphery.
937055611,no,1,I’d argue that it’s implausible to claim that TPP could add more than a fraction of one percent to the incomes of the nations involved; even the 0.5 percent suggested by Petri et al looks high to me.
937053886,no,1,"Unable to backtrack, they went even deeper, insisting despite all appearances that monetary policy had no real effects whatsoever, that it was all technological shocks."
937053556,no,0.6624,The thing which is needed to secure healthy conditions is the most speedy and complete adaptation possible of the structure of production to the proportion between the demand for consumers’ goods and the demand for producers’ goods as determined by voluntary saving and spending.
937054015,no,0.6549,"Because we once again have a significant sized domestic oil industry, falling prices now create losers as well as winners within the US."
937056622,no,1,You can guess where I stand on this.
937057146,no,1,Neil Irwin has a nice piece about high asset prices that actually ties into my Wicksell discussion from earlier today.
937057142,no,1,"The thing is, Tett is a smart observer who talks to a lot of people in finance; seeing her present a discredited theory as obviously true, without so much as mentioning the kind of analysis that has been worked all along, says bad things about the extent to which anyone who matters has learned anything."
937056813,no,1,"For those of us who worried a lot about Japan in the late 1990s and now find the whole advanced world facing similar problems, deja vu comes so often that we get deja vu about getting deja vu."
937056416,no,1,But the broader story here is that we’re increasingly seeing that the problems of the euro extend well beyond the troubles of southern European debtors.
937052258,no,0.6544,"From today’s Times: Besides, no country facing enormous budget deficits, rapid growth in the money supply and the prospect of a sustained currency devaluation as we are has ever experienced deflation."

937053234,no,0.6645,"These concrete proposals would, taken together, actually increase the deficit for the first decade and beyond."

937054721,no,1,"While people were very seriously intoning that it was simplistic and crude to think that those little models could be of any use in a changing world yada yada, macroeconomists were making remarkable, counterintuitive predictions — about inflation (or the lack thereof), about interest rates, about the effects of austerity — that came true and were, if you think about it, an intellectual triumph."

937057246,no,0.6648,I will say that this kind of gratuitous complexification is somewhat characteristic.

937052099,no,0.6554,"And while they haven’t been as deep as the older type of recession, they’ve proved hard to end (not officially, but in terms of employment), precisely because housing — which is the main thing that responds to monetary policy — has to rise above normal levels rather than recover from an interest-imposed slump."

937057043,no,0.6798,"For the world as a whole, the cuts in exports and imports will by definition be equal, so as far as world demand is concerned, trade wars are a wash. OK, I’m sure some people will start shouting “Krugman says protectionism does no harm.” But no: protectionism in general should reduce efficiency, and hence the economy’s potential output."
937052881,no,1,So why is a fiscal response any better?

937056699,no,1,Cohan’s theory of interest rates is basically the old notion of loanable funds: the interest rate is determined by the supply of and demand for credit.
937056958,no,1,"The core of what went wrong in 2008 was the rise of shadow banking; too big to fail was at best marginal, and as Mike Konczal notes, pushing the big banks out of shadow banking, on its own, could make the problem worse by causing the risky stuff to “migrate elsewhere, often to places where there is less regulatory infrastructure.” On health care: leave on one side the virtual impossibility of achieving single-payer."
937053436,no,1,"But it’s pretty clear to me at least that the problem in Virginia was basically the Army of the Potomac, or more specifically many of its officers, who were spooked by Lee and repeatedly failed to carry through even when they had clear advantages."

937052333,no,1,I think so.
937055599,no,1,"One particular misuse of the yay-free-trade sentiment is the persistent effort to make protectionism a cause of economic slumps, and trade liberalization a route to recovery."
937052937,no,1,"That’s because it’s a model of several interacting markets, and you can enter from multiple directions, any one of which is a valid starting point."
937052191,no,1,And that’s what seems to have happened to macroeconomics in much of the economics profession.

937052533,no,0.7138,"Here’s what Obama actually said: Too much regulation or too much spending can stifle innovation, can hamper confidence and growth, and hurt business and families."
937056425,no,1,"The result was a very nasty slump, and a delayed recovery."
937053369,no,1,For the fact is that it’s much harder than most people seem to imagine to tell a Greece-type story about a country with its own currency and a floating exchange rate.
937052654,no,1,Yet the data say otherwise.
937053240,no,1,"Bear in mind that paper money has been in widespread use for a long, long time."
937052416,no,1,"These days, relatively few economists are willing to say straight out that they regard persistent high unemployment as a good thing."
937056269,no,1,"The answer, broadly speaking, is surely that government should do those things it does better than the private sector."
937053613,no,1,"In a way, I’m amazed by economists who find this sort of thing absurd on its face."
937054313,no,1,What would it mean to relax that target?
937055332,no,1,"OK, maybe skip the bowels part."
937054572,no,1,But do they really want to do that?
937053680,no,1,"In part, this notion comes from the fact that trade has grown faster than output since 1950."

937053790,no,1,Rudi asked what would happen if a central bank for some reason suddenly and permanently increased the money supply.
937052154,no,1,So this looks like an estimate from the Obama team itself saying — as best as I can figure it out — that the plan would close only around a third of the output gap over the next two years.

937052309,no,1,"So someone has to be bridging the gap between the short-term assets the public wants to hold and the long-term debt the government wants to issue; call it a carry trade if you like, but it’s a normal and necessary thing."
937052702,no,1,"Just a brief note: one thing that keeps appearing in comments is the notion that because we had a bubble, in which some people were borrowing too much, the economic growth of 2000-2007 wasn’t “real” — that it was all a figment of our imagination."
937053401,no,1,This is true both when the zero lower bound applies and when it doesn’t.

937056809,no,0.6403,The implications are shocking: austerity looks like even more of a catastrophe than the conventional analysis indicates.
937054432,no,1,"After all, the great bulk of the debt is now officially held, the interest rate bears little relationship to market prices, and the interest payments come in part out of funds lent by the creditors."
937055869,no,1,And so it turned out.
937053166,no,1,"So this was equivalent to giving — not lending, not even taking an equity stake — Spain 25 percent of its GDP to bail out its banks."
937053495,no,1,"Judging by later academic reputations, they got quite a group!"
937052743,no,1,So let me try this one more time.
937056873,no,1,"You know what I’m talking about, of course — that feeling of glee mixed with fear as one watches the cynical race-baiting of the Republican establishment finally come home to roost, confirming that you were right to be shrill (and the centrists were naive), but with the slight admixture of panic because one of these guys might actually become president."
937057113,no,1,"Here’s a chart (from data here) showing the change in asset income of seniors from all sources (I couldn’t break out interest) from 2006 to 2010, as interest rates fell through the floor, averaged by quintile: It’s not as smooth as I expected, but it’s clear that the decline was much bigger among the better-off; to the extent that Fed policy was reducing returns, it was reducing inequality among seniors."
937055884,no,1,"Romer and Romer clearly have done an impressively systematic job of identifying financial distress in an objective way; but I wonder, very tentatively, if they’re looking at the wrong variable."

937056783,no,0.6708,"But more important, at this point, is the fact that this position turns out to be politically unsustainable."

937053720,no,0.6613,"David Romer calls this the IS-MP model, and it looks something like this at a given point of time: Here the MP curve represents the central bank’s response function for a given rate of inflation, with rates rising if output goes up a la Taylor."
937055760,no,1,"Even in normal times, this approach, Mickey Mouse as it looks, offers a big step up in sophistication from a lot of what you hear – including what you hear from economists who are all teched up but have no idea how to apply their equations to anything real."

937056322,no,1,"The reality is that spending on “income security” — which includes virtually everything except Medicaid that you could construe as aid to people with low incomes — has basically been flat for decades, with a temporary (and appropriate) spurt due to unemployment benefits and food stamps during the Great Recession: If you don’t believe this, think about it: where are these big anti-poverty programs?"
937052490,no,1,In some posts I have expressed skepticism about how effective the Fed can be; in others I have called on the Fed to do more.

937057243,no,1,"Sorry, but no winners here, just big losers."
937052916,no,1,"If you have a different model, fine; but if all you have to counter my model is a set of prejudices, you don’t have an argument."
937056797,no,1,"Was that because the US, with its weak unions and competitive labor markets, had more wage and price flexibility than other nations?"
937052707,no,1,"In other words, past growth wasn’t an illusion, or a fraud; but we need policies to sustain aggregate demand."
937052406,no,1,"It’s a “real” business cycle phenomenon, and the best thing to do is let the free market have its recession or depression for as long as the free market wants (and we had some doozys before Keynes, and often)."
937052549,no,1,"And this raises the specter what I think of as the price stability trap: suppose that it’s early 2012, the US unemployment rate is around 10 percent, and core inflation is running at 0.3 percent."
937053811,no,1,I’m not going to get into that fight.
937056261,no,1,"Brad DeLong has posted a draft statement on fiscal policy for the IMF conference on “rethinking macroeconomics” — and I’m shocked, in a good way."
937053897,no,1,But you don’t have to go back to 2010.
937053602,no,1,"But you go to economic debates with the profession you have, not the profession you want."
937054045,no,1,"Indeed, it’s where I started."
937053231,no,1,"There is, once again, no specification of how this is to be accomplished; bear in mind that this number includes defense, which is currently around 4 percent of GDP."
937055155,no,1,"Think about Heritage: It’s immensely wealthy, and could surely afford to hire a technically competent right-wing hack."
937056752,no,1,But why should we believe that conclusion?
937056703,no,1,"The Fed sets interest rates, whether it wants to or not — even a supposed hands-off policy has to involve choosing the level of the monetary base somehow, which means that it’s a monetary policy choice."
937056876,no,1,"But one downside of The Donald’s turn in the spotlight is that the policy positions of the tonsorially conventional candidates are going largely unscrutinized, which is bad."
937052078,no,1,I guess we’ll see.
937053232,no,1,Is this a plan?
937052240,no,1,It’s just different presentations of the same model.
937053188,no,1,"Time was when Keynesians were highly skeptical about the effectiveness of monetary policy under any circumstances; evidence, including but not only Friedman and Schwartz, persuaded the school otherwise."
937056748,no,1,"Yet when the BIS — which was, once again, dead wrong on inflation — does the same thing, it’s taken very seriously."
937052664,no,0.65,"I occasionally mention here that recognizing the reality of wage stickiness is a key part of demand-side economics, but I’ve also argued a number of times that cutting wages now would probably make the slump worse, not better."
937055184,no,1,"The result was that MIT macroeconomics was teched up — everyone learned how to write down and solve rational expectations models, everyone learned how to emulate Lucas disciples — but didn’t unlearn Keynesian insights."
937052388,no,0.6504,"Right now, China’s dollar holdings don’t give it any leverage over the United States."
937056856,no,1,The path from Friedman and Schwartz to goldbuggism took several decades.
937053485,no,1,"It can and should try to push unconventional policies, but it needs as much help as possible from fiscal policy too — not a situation in which austerity in the periphery is reinforced by austerity in the core, too."
937056022,no,1,What strikes me on reading accounts of how this played out are two things.
937057017,no,1,Total final spending on domestically produced goods and services is Total domestic spending + Exports – Imports = GDP Now suppose we have a trade war.
937056654,no,0.645,"China clearly has a weakening economy, whatever the official numbers may say, and would like to use monetary stimulus."
937053986,no,0.6405,"If you kept turning out clever papers and giving great seminars — I used to pride myself on turning out the best paper in the field each year (not a bit arrogant, not me) and giving the best seminars in the profession — you’d get a tenure offer somewhere good really soon, and your home school would almost surely match."
937055588,no,1,"Actually, I was glad to see Larry Summers weigh in on the same subject in yesterday’s FT. Reading that piece, you may wonder what just happened – did Larry come out for the deal or against it?"
937053118,no,1,"I’d say that this was attacking a straw man, but that would be an insult to straw men."
937056628,no,0.6535,"They took it as an observed fact that fluctuations in nominal demand were associated with fluctuations in real output, as opposed to merely affecting the price level, which shouldn’t happen if prices were flexible."
937053648,no,1,"It might do that, or fiscal policy might be forced into action, if the economy really were suffering from accelerating deflation; but instead all you see is low inflation, which might even lead some central bankers to declare that they were doing their job just fine."
937054300,no,1,"Well, even smart, flexible people can fall prey to incestuous amplification."
937052688,no,1,"So I can just add percentage changes, without having to worry about compounding.)"
937054169,no,1,And the divide seems to depend on one thing: whether the economist in question is currently in a policy position.
937054451,no,1,Keep your eyes on that ball.
937055736,no,1,"What many macroeconomists don’t realize, I believe, is that Hicks on Keynes actually grows directly from Hicks’s own work on microeconomics — not mainly macroeconomics — embodied in his book Value and Capital."
937056399,no,0.6747,"Right now the core euro countries believe that the rest of the euro area can handle it, which might be true."
937056537,no,1,"On a quarterly basis, GDP was rising by mid-2002, and the economy was growing rapidly by 2003."
937056995,no,1,"Even among those who don’t believe in the phony scandals, there is, as there was in 2008, a desire for someone new, who they imagine won’t bring out all that ugliness."
937055319,no,1,"In normal times, we invoke the convenience of money — its extra liquidity — to explain why people hold money at zero or at any rate low interest rates when there are other safe assets offering higher yields."
937056933,no,1,"Put it this way: for all the talk about being honest and upfront, even Sanders ended up delivering mostly smoke and mirrors — or as Ezra Klein says, puppies and rainbows."
937056311,no,0.6714,"The false belief is that government deficits necessarily “crowd out” investment, so that reducing deficits should free up funds that lead to higher investment."
937053503,no,1,And now all of that is under siege.
937052241,no,1,"So what determines the level of GDP, and hence also ties down the interest rate?"
937056295,no,1,"As the report notes, weak business investment has been a major reason for global economic weakness."
937052118,no,1,This raises real concerns about whether the incoming administration is lowballing its plans in an attempt to get bipartisan consensus.
937053854,no,1,"Certainly nobody can accuse him of that failing: he’s been warning about looming inflation for four years, eleven months,and two weeks, and hasn’t let the fact that inflation has kept falling below target alter his concerns in the slightest."
937052498,no,1,"What that means is that while the Fed should be doing more, so should other actors: unconventional monetary policy should go along with fiscal stimulus."
937053588,no,1,"More important, stagflation led to a major rethinking of macroeconomics, all across the board; even staunch Keynesians conceded that Friedman/Phelps had been right (indeed, they may have conceded too much), and the vertical long-run Phillips curve became part of every textbook."
937057309,no,1,"That, however –as Irving Fisher could have told them!"
937056506,no,1,"The chart shows a scatterplot of Greece’s output gap (as estimated by the IMF — a dubious measure, but stay with it) versus the rate of change of the GDP deflator."
937052095,no,1,"Each of the slumps — 1969-70, 1973-75, and the double-dip slump from 1979 to 1982 — were caused, basically, by high interest rates imposed by the Fed to control inflation."
937056018,no,1,"Today in my Civil War obsession: some readers may recall that I’m a big U.S. Grant admirer; the scene at Appomattox, where the dashing cavalier Lee surrendered to the stumpy, grimy Grant, marks the coming of the modern era."
937052201,no,1,"All this is familiar stuff to economists, or should be."
937052574,no,1,What’s wrong with that argument?
937053522,no,1,Unclear.
937052516,no,1,And there’s a fair bit of empirical evidence to that effect.
937056300,no,1,"He’s looking at me funny!” hypothesis – the claim that President Obama, by occasionally suggesting that some businessmen have behaved badly, has hurt their feelings and perpetuated the slump."
937053710,no,0.6488,"The Maddison database gives us a 45 percent rise in global GDP per capita over the same period, so this calculation suggests that rising trade was responsible for around 10 percent of overall global growth."
937052577,no,1,"After all, to a first approximation debt is money we owe to ourselves – yes, the US has debt to China etc., but that’s not at the heart of the problem."
937052268,no,1,I’m a big advocate of much strengthened financial regulation.
937056652,no,1,China’s decision to devalue the renminbi had some economic logic behind it.
937052524,no,1,So it’s time to start focusing on downward rigidity and what it implies.
937057328,no,1,"In the figure, I use orange to represent Trump (I tried to replicate the spray tan, but this was as close as I could get), and red to represent non-Trump."
937057104,no,0.6753,"It might mean rates below the Wicksellian natural rate, which is the rate that produces stable inflation — but with inflation consistently below the Fed’s target, this criterion would if anything say that rates are artificially high, propped up by the zero lower bound."
937052315,no,0.6803,"Still, what about the possibility of a squeeze, in which rising rates for whatever reason produce a vicious circle of collapsing balance sheets among the carry traders, higher rates, and so on?"
937052379,no,1,"Hence the growing preference among many economists for measures like medians and trimmed means, which exclude prices that move by a lot in any given month, presumably therefore isolating the prices that move sluggishly, which is what we want."
937053791,no,0.6491,"In the long run, just about all economists agreed that this would lead to an equal proportional rise in the price level and depreciation of the currency."
937053889,no,1,And that insight has stood the test of time.
937053314,no,1,Until recently even Republicans were OK with this.
937052741,no,1,I’ve been on this case for a while.
937052330,no,1,"Why, exactly, would the Fed funds rate rise sharply?"
937056289,no,1,But he certainly has the principle right.
937056940,no,1,But it’s not something most Americans want to hear about; foreign single-payer systems are actually more like Medicaid than they are like Medicare.
937052210,no,1,But that’s still the main point — and now it’s been expounded on TV!
937052623,no,1,That passage has been held up by many people as an example of the wrong-headedness that prevailed at the time.
937053922,no,1,Actual premium numbers come in and they’re surprisingly low — not mentioned.
937052353,no,0.6914,"Why do we need such a concept, and how should it be measured?"
937056605,no,0.6901,"The GOP, on the other hand, is a deeply radical faction; even its supposed moderates are moderate only in tone, not in policy positions, and its base is motivated by anger against Others."
937053241,no,1,"Originally these were often notes from private banks, like the $10 (“dix”) note from the Citizen’s Bank of Louisiana that may have given rise to the term “Dixie” for the south."
937053515,no,1,"See the comments section of the linked piece for variations on the “notably rare exceptions” trope; e.g., “With notably rare exceptions, Newt Gingrich is a loyal and faithful husband.” No, what really distinguishes Greenspan here are two things."
937057196,no,0.7025,"What it actually does, of course, is buy stuff, usually short-term government debt but nowadays sometimes other stuff."
937054305,no,1,Most discussion is framed in terms of what happens to the debt.
937052404,no,1,"Richard Serlin, in comments at Mark Thoma’s place, makes a very good point about the efforts of Rajan and others to come up with a reason to raise interest rates even in the face of high unemployment and incipient deflation."
937056308,no,1,And the instrument it uses is fiscal consolidation.
937052097,no,1,"Since the mid 1980s, however, we’ve had the “Great Moderation,” with inflation quiescent."
937056834,no,1,But what worked in the 70s and 80s doesn’t look so good for recent experience: Why didn’t the sustained high unemployment after 2008 push us into deflation?
937052531,no,1,"That sounded odd, since Obama is not, in fact, given to random business-bashing."
937052935,no,0.6618,"Fair enough – this blogosphere conversation has been an exchange among insiders, and probably a bit baffling to normal human beings (which is why I have been labeling my posts “wonkish”)."
937053966,no,1,"Their basic point is that successful economists tend to be intellectually arrogant because they live in a social setup that is very hierarchical, with steep gradients of prestige, widespread agreement about what constitutes good work and who is doing it, and pretty big rewards by professorial standards for climbing to the top of the heap."
937056672,no,1,"Instead, they went for a small move that was sufficient to destabilize expectations while producing trivial benefits."
937053116,no,1,A relatively encouraging month on the jobs front?
937053954,no,1,"If you don’t get that, you don’t appreciate the depths to which all too many economists sank."
937056627,no,1,"In the beginning, Lucas and disciples had a very clear statement of both the problem and their solution."
937053936,no,1,It has historically been the weapon of powerless people aimed at the powerful.
937052559,no,1,"One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world."
937053565,no,1,"OK, you can stop laughing now."
937056580,no,1,"People believed Madoff because he was their kind of guy, never mind the implausibility of his claims; they believe Ron Paul for the same reason."
937053294,no,1,Aha.
937053802,no,1,"Certainly, there was a long period in which the assumption of sticky prices was a recipe for instant rejection at many leading journals."
937052763,no,1,"So Fed policy, by moving interest rates, normally exerts its effect mainly through housing."
937052880,no,1,Note also that nominal GDP never moved at all despite the huge amount of money “printed”.
937052247,no,1,"That’s not just what I say, by the way: the FT reports that the Fed’s own economists estimate the desired Fed funds rate at -5 percent."
937056634,no,1,"It was a lovely, intellectually interesting and exciting approach."
937057230,no,1,Which brings me to the latest fight.
937056441,no,1,But no — it’s a complete puzzle.
937053108,no,1,All these predictions have been borne out.
937055729,no,1,Haven’t the academic economists been squabbling nonstop?
937057349,no,1,This is pretty funny if you remember anything about the 2012 campaign.
937052661,no,1,"But they don’t say any of that — they exploited the temporary bulge to make a false claim, and have gone mum since."
937052096,no,1,"In each case housing tanked, then bounced back when interest rates were allowed to fall again."
937057048,no,0.6892,"Yes, trade fell a lot between 1929 and 1933, but that was almost entirely a consequence of the Depression, not a cause."
937056455,no,0.6819,"is basically promising that as president, he can generate Florida-style bubbles, which bring disaster when they burst, to the rest of America!"
937054297,no,1,So why this divide?
937056526,no,1,"As so often in recent years, the best hope for an answer comes from turning to history; even though exits from a currency union are rare, we do have cases that seem to offer reasonable parallels, notably Argentina’s abandonment of the convertibility law — basically a supposedly permanent one-peso-one-dollar rule — at the beginning of 2002."
937057343,no,1,"This manipulation, he says, is “robbing Americans of billions of dollars of capital and millions of jobs.”"
937052900,no,1,On the first three I think I was completely right.
937054165,no,1,"Unusually, Olivier and I do have a significant disagreement right now, over US monetary policy (this isn’t insider info — he told the conference about it later that day)."
937057013,no,1,"After all, doesn’t everyone know that protectionism causes recessions?"
937054880,no,1,Was this bad diplomacy on the part of Tsipras/Varoufakis?
937056918,no,1,"You may think you’re being wise and judicious, but you’re actually engaged in an act of evasion."
937057174,no,0.6494,"Here, for example, is a comparison of the US and France: Second, if Fed purchases of bonds are crucial to keeping rates down, we should see spikes in rates when those purchases stop."
937057298,no,1,"The BIS basically claimed that mass unemployment was the result of structural mismatch — workers had the wrong skills, and/or were in the wrong sectors."
937057197,no,1,It’s not a gift.
937053345,no,0.6732,"The news from Spain, with vast protests and talk of secession, suggests that this moment may be approaching fast."
937056862,no,1,The question of whether inadequate policy should be viewed as tightening may seem like a fun word game.
937055868,no,0.6746,All of this was predicted in advance by those of us who understood and appreciated Hicksian analysis.
937052961,no,1,What use is this framework?
937054591,no,1,"Again, wanna bet on it?"
937056477,no,0.6405,"This helps avoid pressure to pursue procyclical policies that make the economy unstable, and also gives a better idea of the long-run sustainability of the position."
937054151,no,1,And it’s not as if Moore and Laffer are guys who may lack academic cred but have proved themselves as working analysts.
937053412,no,1,"That hasn’t materialized (and for that matter, even Japan never had more than very gradual deflation)."
937053701,no,1,"They make some funny assumptions about distributions — hey, that’s kind of the price of entry for this kind of work — and in return get a tractable model that yields gravity-type equations for international trade flows."
937052169,no,1,"If the government borrows a dollar from you, that is a dollar that you do not spend, or that you do not lend to a company to spend on new investment."
937057056,no,1,But the story line has persisted nonetheless.
937057397,no,1,The falseness of that belief was most spectacularly demonstrated by the debacle in Iraq.
937052853,no,1,"But the Sams are balance-sheet constrained, while the Janets aren’t, so this is a net positive for aggregate demand."
937057037,no,1,"Actually, no."
937052849,no,1,What can be done?
937057237,no,1,"that is, it’s intervening to prop the yuan up, not hold it down."
937052108,no,1,"I’ve combined them with BLS data to produce price-rent ratios, normalized so that January 2000=100: And here’s a trip down memory lane: “A national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the United States” — Alan Greenspan, October 2004."
937052491,no,0.6931,But these aren’t contradictory positions.
937055328,no,1,"Unemployment is falling, and is now very close to previous estimates of the NAIRU, the unemployment rate at which inflation begins accelerating."

937056476,no,1,"When we look at our budgets, we normally focus not on the headline budget balance but on the cyclically adjusted balance — an estimate of what it would be at more or less full employment."
937057159,no,0.6446,"Partly that they’re low by historical standards — but there are enough changes in the landscape, from deleveraging to demography, that this isn’t a convincing argument."
937056827,no,1,"(Britain imposed a lot of austerity from 2010 to 2012, but it grew in 2013."
937056777,no,0.6749,But the question Beckworth should be asking himself is why almost nobody on the right is willing to think clearly about this issue.
937052259,no,0.6739,These factors are harbingers of inflation.
937053557,no,1,"If the proportion as determined by the voluntary decisions of individuals is distorted by the creation of artificial demand, it must mean that part of the available resources is again led into a wrong direction and a definite and lasting adjustment is again postponed."

937057166,no,1,"When I read opinion pieces by insiders, I often find the ostensible argument less interesting than what is taken for granted."
937052684,no,1,Let me offer a stylized example to explain why.
937052615,no,1,So that’s my plan.
937053119,no,1,What is going on in Cowen’s head?
937056854,no,1,"I mean, who needs the Fed when everyone knows it caused the Great Depression."
937056789,no,1,"The Republicans wanted to portray Hillary Clinton as a super-villain, and ended up making her look like a superhero."
937056388,no,1,The bottom line here is that there’s plenty of real stupidity in the world; we don’t need to add to the cloud of confusion with a critique of imaginary stupidity.
937052530,no,1,"Instead he lashed out at “unscrupulous and underhanded businesses, who are unencumbered by any restriction on activities that might harm the environment, take advantage of middle-class families, or, as we’ve seen, threaten to bring down the entire financial system.” This kind of gratuitous and overstated demonisation – widely seen in the business community as a resort to economic populism on the part of Mr Obama to shore up the growing weakness in his political standing – is exactly the wrong approach."
937057119,no,1,"John Galt, it turns out, wants price supports."
937053049,no,1,A followup to my post about modern Chicago economists forgetting what Milton Friedman knew: recent events have actually given us a dramatic demonstration of the reality of nominal wage stickiness.
937053828,no,1,"As I’ve written before someplace, it’s the story of a farmer who stays inside when it’s raining and puts in extra hours when the sun is shining."
937055008,no,1,There are actually multiple revelations in that article.
937052200,no,0.6777,"And under depression conditions, where you’re in a liquidity trap, the interest rate is entirely determined by liquidity preference, because the interest rate is zero and can go no lower."
937056835,no,0.6743,"There are some popular stories — downward nominal wage rigidity that makes the long-run Phillips curve non-vertical at low inflation rates, “anchored” inflation expectations — and I cite those stories myself."
937054285,no,1,"I mention this not to claim membership of an exclusive club, but by way of noting that most of this group shares fairly similar views about how policy works."
937054314,no,1,"It would not mean demanding that creditors throw good money after bad; everyone has already implicitly acknowledged that the debt will never be fully paid at market rates, but Greece is making a transfer to its creditors by running a primary surplus, and we’re just arguing now about how big that transfer will be."
937053411,no,0.6842,Inflation has stayed very subdued; but coming in to the crisis I certainly thought that actual Japanese-style deflation was a real possibility.
937057140,no,1,"Oh, and Tett ends the piece by citing the Bank for International Settlements as a voice of wisdom."

937057025,no,1,"Yes, trade fell a lot between 1929 and 1933, but that was almost entirely a consequence of the Depression, not a cause."
937056017,no,1,"That is, charlatans and cranks can, all too easily, end up claiming credit for economic and demographic trends that are actually the result of air conditioning."
937053089,no,1,How could anyone who thought about this for even a minute — let alone someone with an economics training — get this wrong?

937053980,no,1,"Having sufficient reputation gets you into a charmed circle; as I wrote in that old essay, In the modern academic world there tends, in any given field — whether it is international finance, Jane Austen studies, or some branch of endocrinology — to be a “circuit”, the people who get invited to speak at academic conferences, who form a sort of de facto nomenklatura."
937055759,no,1,So what is the payoff to this application of miniature general-equilibrium theorizing to macro?

937053144,no,0.6496,"Mainly as a note to myself: What was once Peter Kenen’s big insight about optimum currency areas is now a commonplace: They’re much more likely to be workable if you have fiscal federalism, so that there are large automatic transfers to depressed regions."

937053788,no,1,"I was Rudi’s student when he was working out the classic “overshooting” model, and got to see a bit of the struggle involved – because like almost all seemingly simple ideas in economics, it was the product of a lot of hard thinking."
937055032,no,1,"First, austerity has a very negative effect on output in a country that does not have its own currency, and therefore cannot offset the fall in demand with monetary policy."

937053531,no,1,"And the question is, where the heck is that coming from?"
937052084,no,1,So this is just poisoning the well for health care reform.

937055752,no,1,"In practice we think that AS is very, very flat in the short run, so that you do better by just putting GDP on the axis, but this is good enough for my purposes now."
937052172,no,1,"We can build roads instead of factories, but fiscal stimulus can’t help us to build more of both.1 This is just accounting, and does not need a complex argument about “crowding out.” Second, investment is “spending” every bit as much as consumption."

937053174,no,1,"There are close parallels, as well there might be, since the trouble in macro is in effect a symptom of this wider political war."

937053466,no,1,And the lineage goes back even further.
937053452,no,1,"What I do recall, however — which the Journal apparently doesn’t — is that the BIS has spent years warning about the dangers of low interest rates."
937056572,no,0.6577,And I found myself thinking about the remarkable fact that there really are people who will buy that video.
937055337,no,1,"Circa 1994 it was widely believed, based on seemingly solid research, that the NAIRU was around 6 percent; but Greenspan and company decided to wait for actual evidence of rising inflation, and the result was a long run of job growth that brought unemployment below 4 percent without any kind of inflationary explosion."
937056363,no,1,"As I wrote in one context, often what they imagine to be a big conceptual or empirical failure is just a failure of their own reading comprehension."

937056430,no,0.6734,"This time not, so that there is no quick way to adjust to adverse shocks: This shouldn’t come as a surprise; it’s the core of the classic Milton Friedman argument for flexible exchange rates, and in turn for the tradeoff at the core of optimum currency area theory."

937057248,no,0.6859,"Yes, you can raise some questions about the price-stability interpretation if the long-run Phillips curve isn’t vertical at low inflation, but that’s a fairly minor twiddle."
937053578,no,1,Some of us came into the global crisis with a well-worked-out theory of monetary and fiscal policy in a liquidity trap; the predictions of that theory have been completely consistent with actual experience.
937056645,no,0.6538,"I wrote last year about the remarkable failure of RBC theorists ever to offer an intuitive explanation of how their models work, which I at least hinted was willful: But the RBC theorists never seem to go there; it’s right into calibration and statistical moments, with never a break for intuition."

937054052,no,1,"In that model, the multiplier is one.)"
937056038,no,1,"But one reason for the sluggish growth in demand for U.S.-produced goods and services was a huge trade deficit, the counterpart of huge reserve accumulation in China and other emerging markets."

937052622,no,1,"There’s a famous passage in Schumpeter’s writings during the Great Depression, in which he lays out the extreme liquidationist position, arguing not just against the use of fiscal policy to fight unemployment but even against monetary policy, lest it get in the way of the “work of depressions”."

937055306,no,0.6893,"It’s widely understood that the financial crisis and aftermath make the zero lower bound — even if less binding than we used to think — a very real concern, which means that not undershooting inflation targets is important."

937055166,no,1,"But today’s a good day for that, I think."

937053044,no,1,Quite.
937054754,no,0.6662,"So, let’s start by thinking about an economy in normal times, i.e., not at the zero lower bound (which is squishier than we thought, but still relevant.)"
937056495,no,0.703,"Suppose, to be concrete, that we talk about permanently raising the primary surplus by one percent of GDP."
937052380,no,0.6514,"And what these measures show is an ongoing process of disinflation that could, in not too long, turn into outright deflation: Japan, here we come."
937053582,no,1,"PS: A further count against the claim that interest on excess reserves explains everything is the fact that public holdings of currency have also surged, even though the Fed isn’t paying interest on dead presidents: Again, this is exactly what liquidity-trap models, like my 1998 paper, predicted."
937056587,no,1,"They hear that the Fed is printing money, and it sounds to them like a violation of both the laws of economics and morality — and they surely think of it as a plot to take away their completely earned gains and give them to Those People (hence the whiteness issue)."
937054002,no,1,But here’s one question: Are the reputations deserved?
937055743,no,1,"Say that there are three goods, X, Y, and Z."
937054894,no,1,I’ve long believed that Matthew Yglesias hit on something really important when he noted that small-country politicians generally have personal incentives to go along with troika demands even if they are against their nation’s interests: Normally you would think that a national prime minister’s best option is to try to do the stuff that’s likely to get him re-elected.
937053351,no,1,"People seem to think that it means that (a) internal devaluation can never work (b) any sign of recovery, even a partial rebound, proves Keynes/Krugman wrong (this is a critical part of Baltic boosterism, where the partial recovery of Latvia and Estonia is supposed to be some kind of incredible triumph)."
937056372,no,0.6625,"Because long-lived investments are very sensitive to interest rates, short-lived investments not so much."

937052072,no,1,In both cases the employment slump went on for a long time after the recession was supposedly over.
937055598,no,1,"But because economists want to keep shouting yay free trade, they look for reasons why those gains might be larger – even though the stories they then end up telling are inconsistent with the competitive model that was the basis for free-trade advocacy in the first place."
937053268,no,1,"Mark Thoma links to an old piece of mine that I think does a pretty good job of laying out that standard case; but we now know that there’s a major additional concern, the ability of the central bank to act as lender of last resort to the government as well as private banks."
937053892,no,1,"After the laughing and mocking and the calling of security, let’s say you offered this prediction in the form a of a bet."
937052830,no,1,"Yet that can’t be right; if it were, we wouldn’t have a problem in the first place."
937056617,no,1,But the Republican base isn’t eager to hear from SHCs; it has never put McCain on a pedestal; and people who like Donald Trump are not exactly likely to be scared off by his lack of decorum.

937056764,no,1,"As if to illustrate his point, this remarkable piece of reporting by Confessore, Cohen, and Yourish documents the remarkable fact that campaign finance this election cycle is dominated by a tiny number of extremely wealthy people — more than half the total from just 158 families."
937057059,no,1,"Maybe rates weren’t artificially low, after all?"
937057297,no,1,"At least since 2010 the BIS position has basically been the same as that of 1930s liquidationists like Schumpeter, who warned against any “artificial stimulus” that might leave the “work of depressions undone.” And in 2010-2011 it had an intellectually coherent — factually wrong, but coherent — story underlying that position."
937052793,no,1,"People make portfolio choices, allocating their wealth among bonds, stocks, etc.. Asset prices – including the famous “q” – rise and fall to match these portfolio choices to the actual asset supplies."
937052556,no,1,So says one of my commenters.
937057399,no,1,Nor is the threat of retaliation the only factor that should deter any hard protectionist turn.
937052718,no,1,"This was the oh-God-we’re-all-gonna-die period, when everyone rushed into the most liquid securities; TIPS, being not as liquid as the much more widely traded regular bonds, went for a big discount that pushed real yields way up."
937056564,no,1,"As usual, we see a clear negative association, consistent with a Keynesian story."

937055028,no,0.6627,"The Greek government is not calling for a return to primary deficits; as I understand it, it is merely proposing that it be allowed to stabilize the surplus at that level, as opposed to raising it to 4.5 percent of GDP, a number that has few precedents in history."

937053450,no,1,His views also matter for another reason: the BIS is one of the few international financial institutions (some say the only one) to see the financial crisis coming and to issue clear warnings ahead of time.
937053117,no,1,Keynesianism is wrong!
937053826,no,0.6728,"I mean, I could do it myself."

937053497,no,1,Portugal in the summer of 1976 was a bizarrely interesting place — still somewhat chaotic in the aftermath of both the coup and the withdrawal from its African empire (the hotels were filled with “returnees” from Africa placed there on a temporary basis).
937056689,no,1,"Someone needs to tell the Chinese, you shall not crucify this country on a cross of SDRs."

937054069,no,1,"Just to be clear, I have supported QE in both Britain and the US, on the grounds that (a) central bank purchases of longer-term and riskier assets may help and can’t hurt, and (b) given political paralysis in the US and the dominance of bad macroeconomic thinking in the UK, it’s all we’ve got."

937053291,no,0.652,"That is, however, a strange comparison: other things equal, you’d expect government employment to grow with population (remember, the typical government employee is a schoolteacher)."
937052649,no,0.6614,We might nonetheless have been able to get through this with less damage if we’d had strong leadership and clear thinking from the economics profession.
937054717,no,1,"If you want to ignore all that, because in the long run it’s the fundamentals that matter, you’re exactly the kind of person Keynes was mocking: But this long run is a misleading guide to current affairs."
937056839,no,1,Here’s what it looks like using Ball’s estimates of the fall in potential output: Is there a policy moral from these supply-side failures of the pre-crisis doctrine?
937056952,no,0.6585,"Her biggest vice, from my point of view, is listening too much to consultants who want to make cheap shots, like the claim that the Sanders plan would kill Medicaid, when her real strength comes when she lets her inner wonk and fundamental toughness shine through."
937052776,no,1,"Anyway, that’s my casual take on what has happened."
937053893,no,1,What odds do you think Obamacare’s critics would have offered?
937052639,no,1,Regular readers may note that my own writing on the current crisis has gotten — I think it has gotten — considerably clearer in the past few weeks.
937052888,no,1,So what was the right answer?
937054129,no,1,"Unfortunately, you see a lot of that, including from economists who really should know better."
937052760,no,1,"Because long-lived investments are very sensitive to interest rates, short-lived investments not so much."
937056650,no,1,"So what happened to freshwater, I’d argue, is that a movement that started by doing interesting work was corrupted by its early hubris; the braggadocio and trash-talking of the 1970s left its leaders unable to confront their intellectual problems, and sent them off on the path Paul now finds so troubling."
937057032,no,1,So here goes.
937057115,no,1,But the very fact that the economy remained depressed despite zero rates was telling us that we were awash in desired savings with no place to go — that’s what a liquidity trap is all about.
937056657,no,0.682,"So it would make sense on purely economic grounds for China to move to a free float, and gain the freedom to use monetary policy that, say, Japan has."
937052913,no,1,"The point, of course, is that your personal incredulity counts for nothing."
937053288,no,1,"During today’s round table on ABC, Rand Paul seemed shocked at my claim that government employment is down under Obama."
937053586,no,1,The first success led to Friedmam’s promotion to demigod status; the second success has not produced any comparable elevation.
937053005,no,1,"For example, we have a pretty good understanding of bank runs; extending that framework to shadow banking requires little more than the understanding that repo and other kinds of short-maturity obligations are, from an economic point of view, more or less equivalent to deposits."
937056557,no,1,So how does the story of the GIIPS fit into this analysis?
937057192,no,0.6658,"Quantitative easing isn’t being imposed on an unwitting populace by financiers and rentiers; it’s being undertaken, to the extent that it is, over howls of protest from the financial industry."
937053711,no,0.6731,My guess is that most people who imagine themselves well-informed would give a bigger number.
937057326,no,0.6545,(This worked better before Marco Rubio’s implosion; Cruz may be just as awful and just as bad a candidate as Trump.)
937052284,no,1,The background here is that there are two problems with estimating multipliers relevant to our current situation.
937056848,no,1,"This was a defensible argument, although it looks much weaker in the light of more recent developments; as I warned in 1998, in a liquidity trap the central bank loses control of monetary aggregates as well as the real economy; it’s by no means clear that the Fed really could have prevented the Depression."
937057135,no,1,"Strikingly, Tett’s version of what went wrong with Gross’s predictions makes no mention of deleveraging and the zero lower bound; it’s all a power play by central banks, which have been “intimidating” bond investors with unconventional monetary policy."
937056523,no,1,"Then Fisher on why austerity hasn’t even helped on the debt: The basic story of the European periphery — not just Greece — is one of a poisonous interaction between Friedman and Fisher, which has produced incredible suffering while failing to reduce the debt/GDP ratio, which even in star pupils like Ireland and Spain is far higher than when austerity began; the only success has been in suffering long enough so that some growth has finally resumed, and they can call it vindication."
937057210,no,1,"Finally, how is expansionary monetary policy supposed to hurt the 99 percent?"
937053541,no,1,"Indeed: one strong indicator that the problem isn’t structural is that as the economy has (partially) recovered, the recovery has tended to be fastest in precisely the same regions and occupations that were initially hit hardest."
937052357,no,1,"And people who say things like “That’s a stupid concept — people have to spend money on food and gas, so they should be in your inflation measures” are missing the point."
937052548,no,0.6496,"The analysis also suggests something else, however: as the inflation rate goes toward zero, it seems to become “sticky”: in the modern world, rapid deflation doesn’t happen, and in fact slight positive inflation often persists in the face of an obviously depressed economy: The authors discuss several possible explanations, but it does seem as if downward nominal rigidity is playing a role."
937057084,no,1,The bailout of big banks left them bigger than ever.
937057341,no,1,The starting point for this debate is Mr. Trump’s deviation from free-market orthodoxy on international trade.
937052786,no,1,As of today.
937054579,no,1,"But as I worried some time ago, this argument becomes moot if the banking system has already collapsed."
937053400,no,1,"In the IS-LM model, the quantity of funds supplied is always equal to the quantity of funds demanded — because the level of output adjusts."
937056485,no,0.6795,"The answer is, not as long as Greece remains in the euro."
937052617,no,1,Update: Henry Aaron is thinking along similar lines.
937052984,no,1,"First, the grim news from Greece is, as many commentators are pointing out, a big refutation for the doctrine of “expansionary austerity.” And it’s worth pointing out that European leaders, and especially the ECB, went in for that doctrine in a big way."
937054896,no,1,"But in the era of globalization and EU-ification, I think the leaders of small countries are actually in a somewhat different situation."
937053700,no,1,"The basic model is Ricardian — wine and cloth and labor productivity and all that — except that there are many goods and many countries, transportation costs, and countries are assumed to gain productivity in any particular industry through a random process."
937052894,no,1,2
937057112,no,0.6688,"Most retired Americans depend on Social Security for the majority of their income, and have very little in interest earnings; the decline in rates has primarily hurt a small minority of very well-off seniors."
937052504,no,1,"Expected inflation, in turn, is assumed to reflect recent past experience."
937053340,no,1,"Why do it, then?"
937052607,no,0.6387,"On the contrary, it can – and the alternative is a prolonged period of economic weakness that actually makes the debt problem harder to resolve."
937052646,no,1,"But the policies that can prevent that gratuitous slump — a commitment to higher inflation over the medium term, and/or deficit spending — run right up against ingrained prejudices."
937056256,no,1,"Silva Lopes: “We are not a banana republic, we are a pajama republic.” In the years that followed, he added further chapters to his illustrious career — more than I knew, I’m ashamed to say — leading tax reform and more."
937053190,no,0.6667,"More recently the revisions have tended to go in the other direction, with a revival of the concept of the liquidity trap in the light of Japan’s experience, and a renewed acceptance, again based on evidence, that wages are downwardly rigid – and hence that the natural rate hypothesis breaks down at low inflation."
937053603,no,1,"Brad DeLong catches John Cochrane being remarkably dense: Paul Krugman recommended, with refreshing clarity, that the US government fake an alien invasion so we could spend trillions of dollars building useless defenses."
937053465,no,1,"I have to admit that I was predisposed to dislike Klein’s book when it came out, probably out of professional turf-defending and whatever — but her thesis really helps explain a lot about what’s going on in Europe in particular."
937056612,no,1,"We saw this a lot in the cult of Paul Ryan, who was and is very obviously a con man, whose numbers have never added up, but who was nonetheless treated with vast respect — and still sometimes is."
937055163,no,1,"But the book only really covers Chapter I in the MIT saga; while it alludes a bit to the role MIT grads play in the world today, it mostly cuts off circa 1970."
937053885,no,0.645,"But many economists had already dug themselves in too deep, denouncing Keynesian economics as nonsense, declaring it dead."
937055302,no,0.6543,"You also have to wonder about cognitive dissonance: in general, we’re talking about conservatives with vast faith in the wisdom of markets, who somehow are completely sure that markets will make terrible decisions due to low interest rates, and require paternalistic monetary policy to keep them on the strait and narrow."
937056680,no,1,What does America gain from the dollar’s special role?
937057355,no,0.702,"More important than Mr. Romney’s awkward history here, however, is the fact that his economic analysis is all wrong."
937052816,no,0.645,"So it’s not safe to assume that the Fed can, for example, hit any target for nominal GDP that it chooses."
937052951,no,1,"That means that loanable funds doesn’t determine the interest rate per se; it determines a set of possible combinations of the interest rate and GDP, with lower rates corresponding to higher GDP."
937053124,no,1,And they are contemptuous about claims of price manipulation.
937053387,no,0.6899,"But I decided not to post anything about it; instead, I wanted to wait and see which right-wing media outlets would fall for the hoax."
937053216,no,1,"You need to distinguish between the first decade, before the phasing out of Medicare as we know it begins, and after."
937055751,no,0.6662,"Yes – but you can get there by invoking sticky prices and/or wages, so that there’s an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve, without changing the figure."
937057293,no,1,I have tried–I have tried very hard–to wrap my mind around just what the BIS position is.
937054288,no,1,"Unusually, Olivier and I do have a significant disagreement right now, over US monetary policy (this isn’t insider info — he told the conference about it later that day)."
937053819,no,1,"So, in some cases, can jargon, which used right can both save time and add clarity to the discussion."
937054014,no,1,But shale has in some important ways arguably changed the nature of that impact.
937057366,no,1,So Mr. Romney is talking nonsense.
937053744,no,1,"He focuses on China’s motives, which is useful."
937053667,no,1,"Or maybe not, because who exactly is supposed to be on the receiving end of our improved balance?"
937052582,no,1,(Sam and Janet who?
937053640,no,0.6984,"You basically represent the demand side of the economy with an IS curve; you imagine that monetary policy follows some kind of Taylor rule, in which the central bank sets interest rates based on the inflation rate and possibly some measure of economic slack; and you represent the supply side of the economy with a post-Friedmanite Phillips curve in which inflation rises ever higher if the economy is operating above potential, falls ever lower if the economy is operating below potential."
937056349,no,1,"No, I don’t think so."
937052179,no,0.699,"It’s like the fact that the capital account and the current account of the balance of payment have to sum to zero: that’s true, but it does not mean that an increase in capital inflows magically translates into a trade deficit, without anything else changing (what John Williamson used to call the doctrine of immaculate transfer)."
937056417,no,1,"Economic performance has also been very bad in several northern nations with good credit ratings and low borrowing costs — Finland, Denmark (which isn’t on the euro but shadows it), the Netherlands."
937052769,no,1,"Nonresidential investment has been rising rapidly, but it was doing that even before QE2 was announced."
937056844,no,1,"Again, I don’t think even Hicksian-inclined economists have taken all of this sufficiently into account."
937054298,no,1,"We don’t have access to different facts; we don’t, in any fundamental sense, have different economic models."
937052583,no,0.6577,"If you’d grown up in my place and time, you’d know the answer: Sam and Janet evening / You will see a stranger … But actually, I’m thinking of the two kinds of agent in the Kiyotaki-Moore model.)"
937056325,no,1,"Meanwhile, it’s not true that poverty has been unchanged; the standard measure is known to be flawed, and a better measure shows progress, although not as much as we’d like: So it is somewhat disheartening to see the thoroughly debunked narrative still emerging in some of the Baltimore-inspired discussion."
937053309,no,1,Schumpeter declared that Any revival which is merely due to artificial stimulus leaves part of the work of depressions undone Hayek similarly decried any recovery led by the “creation of artificial demand”.
937054035,no,1,What’s going on?
937052075,no,1,There’s still the question of how deep the slump will be.
937057060,no,1,Via Mark Thoma — whom everyone interested in today’s economic debates should check out daily — Thomas Laubach and John C. Williams of the Fed have a new paper updating their estimates of the natural real rate of interest.
937056271,no,1,"The standard, textbook answer is that we should look at public goods — goods that are non rival and non excludable, so that the private sector won’t provide them."
937055589,no,1,"The answer, I think (slide 1), is that he basically supported an idealized TPP that could have been, but came out against the TPP that actually seems to be on the table."
937052883,no,1,A fiscal response to a severe slump doesn’t require committing yourself to changes once the storm has passed; it “only requires unusual action while the situation remains grave.” 2.
937056309,no,1,"That is, it finds cases where spending cuts and/or tax hikes depress demand and hence investment."
937056359,no,1,"There is no evidence that interest rates matter in that way, he says, and economists who talk about natural rates are simply engaged in groupthink."
937054133,no,0.6646,Don’t tighten until you see the whites of inflation’s eyes — and at this point there is absolutely zero sign that inflation is nigh.
937053322,no,1,"So, I’m in jet lag city, which means that it’s time for a euro update."
937052662,no,1,So all that people who live in the intellectually hermetic world of the right ever hear is that government employment is soaring.
937056687,no,1,"In normal times this privilege is worth something like $20-30 billion a year; that’s not a tiny number, but it’s only a small fraction of one percent of GDP."
937052974,no,1,"Yes, IS-LM simplifies things a lot, and can’t be taken as the final word."
937054026,no,1,"The question one might ask is, why is Russia so vulnerable?"
937057388,no,1,"But this isn’t as peculiar a development as it seems. "
937056944,no,1,It’s just a distraction from the real issues.
937053019,no,1,And those who are determined to forget the past run a high risk of reliving it — which is why we’re in the state we’re in.
937052544,no,1,But I guess such rules don’t apply if you’re a conservative.
937056436,no,1,"And this isn’t an ex-post rationale, it’s what many of us were saying from the beginning."
937056020,no,1,And that campaign began in earnest 150 years ago today.
937054454,no,0.6704,"I think it’s important to be as clear as we can about the stakes and the real interests here, lest players stumble into a disaster they could and should have avoided."
937055183,no,0.6615,"I suspect that Rudi Dornbusch’s influence was important here; as I and others have said many times, even a glance at the evidence on exchange rates and prices makes stickiness obvious, which is why international macro never went off the deep end as much as the rest of the field."
937056379,no,1,"And I would say that for many economists of a certain age, the events of the early 1980s were especially important in convincing us that monetary policy can matter a lot."
937057391,no,0.7136,"It’s true that globalization puts downward pressure on the wages of many workers — but progressives can offer a variety of responses to that pressure, whereas on the right, protectionism is all they’ve got."
937057093,no,1,It’s a pretty sorry spectacle.
937056316,no,1,So what we have here is an empirical confirmation of the existence of the paradox of thrift!

937056346,no,1,It slices!
937053334,no,0.6667,But you still need “internal devaluation”: a sharp fall in costs and prices relative to the core.
937053066,no,1,It has no first-starter effect.
937052356,no,1,Core inflation is not used for things like calculating cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security; those use the regular CPI.
937053393,no,1,"But to satisfy those who are for some reason nervous, here’s a brief explanation of why somebody doesn’t understand IS-LM."
937055445,no,1,"But I say, oh yeah?"
937057176,no,1,"Here’s Fed holdings of long-term assets (agency debt plus long-term Treasury debt), from here, versus long-term bond rates: You can see a couple of pauses in the Fed’s expansion of its holdings — and no relationship at all to rates."
937053951,no,1,"Second, there’s the misuse of Ricardian Equivalence."
937053660,no,1,"Why, exactly, did we start running persistent deficits?"
937053864,no,1,I can easily understand it when people don’t know the facts about economic statistics; you need a fair bit of background knowledge even to know how to look these things up.
937053918,no,1,"But when it turns out that the news wasn’t really that bad, these sources just move on."
937053563,no,0.6405,We’re still waiting for that to happen.
937052908,no,1,"(Simulations show, by the way, that chance plus selection can indeed create an eye, in a relatively short time as evolutionary history goes)."
937055000,no,1,"But a genuine government of the left, as opposed to the center-left, is very different — not because its policy ideas are wild and crazy, which they aren’t, but because its officials are never going to be held in high esteem by the Davos set."
937055616,no,1,What do we think about that (slide 7)?
937053630,no,1,"First is the zero lower bound on the interest rate: after a sufficiently large shock, the Taylor rule may say that you should keep cutting rates, but you can’t."
937053807,no,1,"What he gets wrong is in the part I’ve elided with my “…”, in which he asserts that this is all behind us."

937055740,no,1,"The answer is, an economy with three goods, which means that there are two relative prices."

937053333,no,1,"Here are bond yields (monthly averages, with the most recent data standing in for September): Good for him."
937052413,no,0.6854,"Policies of this class are particularly apt to produce additional trouble for the future.” From Schumpeter’s perspective, “depressions are not simply evils, which we might attempt to suppress, butforms of something which has to be done, namely, adjustment to change.” This socially productive function of depressions creates “the chief difficulty” faced by economic policy makers."
937054736,no,1,"Globally, and for the most part even within countries, a rise in debt isn’t an indication that we’re living beyond our means, because as Fatas puts it, one person’s debt is another person’s asset; or as I equivalently put it, debt is money we owe to ourselves — an obviously true statement that, I have discovered, has the power to induce blinding rage in many people."

937053271,no,1,What’s going on?

937053992,no,1,"Each time it has turned out that the Keynesians understood the concepts perfectly well, and that it was the anti-Keynesians, in their haste to cry “Gotcha!”, who were making elementary logical errors or suffering failures of reading comprehension."
937052295,no,1,So here’s what I think they’re thinking — and why it’s wrong-headed.
937053006,no,1,So how is it that policy is so confused and lost?
937056922,no,1,"Now, we’ve been in a liquidity trap for the whole Obama administration so far, giving fiscal policy a much more central role — and the initial stimulus did help quite a lot."
937052557,no,1,"And for my sins, I actually get the reference."
937055753,no,1,"A different kind of objection involves what, exactly, is going on behind these curves."
937053877,no,1,But what really happened in the early 80s was a decisive refutation of Lucasian macroeconomics — albeit a refutation met in many places with denial.
937056338,no,1,It slices!
937052394,no,1,"Part of the answer is that it’s really hard for non-economists — and many economists, too!"
937055145,no,1,CBO has not changed its view that the ACA will reduce the deficit; health costs have not increased faster than before; premiums are not skyrocketing.
937053801,no,1,It was the dominant view in academic macroeconomics.
937056291,no,1,"As Francesco Saraceno notes, the IMF’s research department, which was always excellent, has become an extraordinary source of information and ideas in this Age of Blanchard."
937053506,no,1,And that’s why the misguided policies that are tearing Europe apart are such a tragedy.
937057069,no,1,This in turn tells you several things.
937054037,no,1,"But it’s also true that drastic effects of terms of trade shocks are a fairly common phenomenon in developing countries where the private sector has substantial foreign-currency debt: the initial effect of a drop in export prices is a fall in the currency, this creates balance sheet problems for private debtors whose debts suddenly grow in domestic value, this further weakens the economy and undermines confidence, and so on."
937057139,no,1,"That didn’t happen, which should make you wonder what exactly they mean by saying that rates are artificially low."
937055474,no,1,"So, can we say anything about how the recent move in the euro fits into this story?"
937053537,no,1,An analysis of labor market data suggests that there are no structural changes that can explain movements in unemployment rates over recent years.
937056165,no,1,"Here’s the data from 1996 to 2008, with inflation measured by the GDP deflator and interest rates measured by 6-month Libor: OK, it’s not full equalization."
937053437,no,0.6747,"Grant had completely outmaneuvered Lee several times, for example at Petersburg, which should have been a Vicksburg-style sweep, only to have the moment thrown away by sluggish commanders; the same thing happened to Sheridan in the Valley."
937054438,no,1,What would it mean to relax that target?
937052094,no,1,But the recessions of that era were very different from the recessions since.
937052678,no,0.6417,"No; as I wrote in a little paper at the time, once everyone who could go bankrupt had, any further depreciation would be expansionary."
937055656,no,1,Probably not so much.
937053982,no,1,"It’s hard to get onto the circuit — it takes at least two really good papers, one to get noticed and a second to show that the first wasn’t a fluke — but once you are in, the constant round of conferences and invited papers makes it easy to stay in."
937052611,no,1,"By the way, I’ve said this before."
937052082,no,1,"Sorry, but this is just destructive — like the Obama plan, the Clinton plan offers subsidies to lower-income families."
937052177,no,1,What’s so mind-boggling about this is that it commits one of the most basic fallacies in economics — interpreting an accounting identity as a behavioral relationship.
937057412,no,1,"If U.S. corporations were able to use the threat of imports to smash unions, it was only because our political environment supported union-busting. "
937052202,no,1,But you couldn’t see it on TV — until now.
937054569,no,1,"Instead, the power of the creditors over Greece comes via the ability to crash the Greek banking system, which is heavily dependent on the ability to borrow at need from the ECB."
937053090,no,1,"And yet as far as I can tell almost everyone on the freshwater side of this divide did get it wrong, and has yet to acknowledge the error."
937057229,no,1,"Second, there’s a level of cynicism, of willingness to play politics with foreign affairs, on one side that isn’t matched on the other."
937057381,no,1,The bad news is that it was junk economics on both sides.
937053695,no,1,"Ever-growing trade relative to GDP isn’t a natural law, it’s just something that happened to result from the policies and technologies of the past few generations."
937054283,no,1,"More broadly, many of the people who either make monetary policy or comment on it from fairly influential perches are members of what you might call the 1970s Cambridge mafia."
937053735,no,1,"Furthermore, as Wren-Lewis says, even if there is somehow a squeeze on long-term bonds, why can’t the central bank just buy them up?"
937053391,no,1,Sigh.
937056951,no,1,"Health reform, in fact, as actually enacted is much more like her proposal in 2008 than Obama’s — during that campaign Obama ran some quite ugly Harry-and-Louise type ads attacking the individual mandate, which she correctly insisted was essential."
937056546,no,1,"Despite a striking lack of evidence that “structural reform” delivers much of a growth boost, especially in an economy suffering from a huge output gap, they continue to present structural reform — mainly in the form of disempowering workers — as a sovereign remedy for all ills."
937052931,no,1,"Seeing some growth in Ireland, then, is not at all a refutation of Keynesian economics — it’s exactly what you’d expect, given that Ireland is in fact gradually achieving an “internal devaluation” via relative deflation."
937056423,no,1,A followup to my post inspired by troubles in Finland: it’s worth emphasizing just how bad Finland’s performance has been.
937053170,no,0.6779,Here are the numbers: I think you can make a strong case that if Texas had been an independent country in 1986-87 it would have experienced a huge financial and fiscal crisis.
937057162,no,1,"Once you accept the possibility that rates belong where they are, or even a bit lower, to correspond to the Wicksellian natural rate, you also conclude that asset prices might make sense; and once you concede that asset prices might make sense, you lose the supposed evidence that rates are all wrong."
937053559,no,1,"The only way permanently to “mobilize” all available resources is, therefore, not to use artificial stimulants—whether during a crisis or thereafter—but to leave it to time to effect a permanent cure by the slow process of adapting the structure of production to the means available for capital purposes."
937057133,no,1,"Really, this wasn’t and isn’t hard."
937053764,no,0.678,"It’s a clever idea, but I think incomplete."
937053818,no,1,Math can be a powerful clarifying tool.
937052808,no,0.6798,That hasn’t stopped the 10-year interest rate on its outstanding debt from reflecting investors’ perception of its underlying solvency:
937056367,no,1,"Well, everyone."
937057092,no,1,"So what we get instead is a whitewashing of the intellectual history, in which Fed critics are portrayed as making arguments that haven’t been shown to be ridiculous."
937056755,no,0.6501,"Again, if someone from the center-left were to produce an economic analysis this tendentious, this much at odds with decades of mainstream economics, it would be met with incredulity."
937052920,no,1,"But back to my main point: if you just can’t believe I’m saying the things I say, at least consider the possibility that you’re the one who just doesn’t get it."
937053638,no,1,"So, think about macro as David Romer presented it back in 2000 (pdf)."
937052975,no,1,"But it has done what good economic models are supposed to do: make sense of what we see, and make highly useful predictions about what would happen in unusual circumstances."
937052632,no,1,"For those who haven’t been following, Gauti has really been taking the lead in trying to model policy when interest rates are up against the zero lower bound; what we’re doing here is trying to apply his expertise to the problem of how to think about what happens in a “Minsky moment,” when everyone decides that debt is too high."
937056035,no,0.6547,The most persuasive evidence that the US may face secular stagnation comes from the lackluster recovery of 2001-2007.
937054872,no,1,"In that case the dollar doesn’t move, and the bulk of the demand surge stays in the US."
937053164,no,1,"So that’s around $75 billion in aid — not loans, outright transfer."
937054594,no,1,Steve Rattner has a very puzzling piece in today’s Times.
937056843,no,0.6782,"And fiscal contraction in a liquidity trap seems to be absolutely terrible for the long run as well as the short run, and quite possibly counterproductive even in purely fiscal terms."
937052826,no,0.6606,"The original post:  Sam, Janet, and Fiscal Policy One of the common arguments against fiscal policy in the current situation – one that sounds sensible – is that debt is the problem, so how can debt be the solution?"
937056641,no,0.6849,"it would have taken a lot of intellectual integrity to admit that they might have been premature, that their models weren’t working and that maybe there was something in that Keynesian stuff after all."
937054125,no,1,And that is why we have statistics.
937052102,no,1,"One of my favorite Keynes quotes comes from Essays in Persuasion, in which he tried to explain the nature of the Great Depression, which was still in its early stages, and declared that “we have magneto [alternator] trouble.” The economic engine was as powerful as ever — but one crucial part was malfunctioning, and needed to be fixed."
937056029,no,1,There’s been a really interesting back and forth between Ben Bernanke and Larry Summers over secular stagnation.
937056512,no,0.6516,"OK, we can soften this result by bringing in the effect of falling Greek prices on exports, which should boost economic growth."
937053335,no,1,"And that’s a slow, painful process."
937056374,no,1,"But houses last a long time and don’t become obsolete (the same is true to some extent for business structures, but in a more limited form)."
937056855,no,1,Back to the gold standard!
937056770,no,1,"Basically, we’re looking at the people who brought you the financial crisis trying to buy the chance to do it all over again."
937052515,no,0.6765,"What this literature argues is that, probably due to bounded rationality, there’s some downward inflexibility in prices and wages even after expectations have had time to fully adjust."
937053034,no,1,"Matthew Yglesias finds John Cochrane ridiculing the notion that devaluation makes it easier to bring a country’s relative wages down, whereas the empirical evidence is overwhelming that devaluation does, in fact, do just that."
937055167,no,1,"The basics: while there have been many articles discussing and either celebrating or deploring the influence of the Chicago School, it’s a less often noted fact that right now a remarkable number of the professional economists who either play important roles in making policy or appear to have influence on the discussion got their Ph.Ds from MIT in the second half of the 1970s."
937052401,no,0.6473,The bottom line in all this is that we don’t need the Chinese to keep interest rates down.
937054888,no,0.6449,"And we have often been told that everyone understands that the official target surplus, 4.5 percent of GDP, is unreasonable and unattainable."
937052804,no,1,"So I don’t buy the notion that rates are low only because the Fed is doing QE2; if there were really a problem with the marketability of US debt, rates would be high regardless."
937055890,no,1,"However this dispute eventually pans out, one thing should be clear: whether or not sluggish recovery from financial crisis is the norm, this particular episode didn’t have to happen."
937056859,no,1,He is already on record as an ardent supporter of a return to gold.
937052645,no,1,"The capacity is there, and nothing about the fact that some people have too much debt makes it impossible to use that capacity to produce goods and services for other people."
937057107,no,1,Ben Bernanke’s Brookings blog begins!
937055618,no,0.6461,In that direct sense this introduces a distortion that makes the world a bit poorer.
937053402,no,1,"In fact, that’s the essential insight of IS-LM: both liquidity preference and loanable funds are true, which is possible because both the interest rate and income are adjusting variables."
937056248,no,0.7031,"If true, this says that we have a problem that must be solved with policies that boost demand."
937057252,no,1,And there isn’t.
937053092,no,1,"I didn’t know him well, but like everyone in international economics, I was greatly informed by his work."
937053399,no,1,They’re not the curves that actually apply when the economy is operating below full employment.
937053993,no,1,"You would think that at some point they’d catch on, and realize that New Keynesian economics may be wrong, but it’s not stupid, and neither are the people who do it."
937056820,no,1,"I’m supposed to do a presentation next week about “shifts in economic models,” which has me trying to systematize my thought about what the crisis and aftermath have and haven’t changed my understanding of macroeconomics."
937053837,no,1,It’s actually kind of amazing.
937052227,no,1,"But in any case, this is really sad: John Hicks knew far more about this in 1937 than people who think they’re sophisticates know now."
937052780,no,0.6982,"The first page looked like this: You can see the unemployment forecast, with the amazing 2.8 percent prediction, in the fourth set of figures."
937056694,no,0.6822,"So here’s William Cohan in the Times, declaring that the Fed should “show some spine” and raise rates even though there is no sign of accelerating inflation."
937056740,no,1,"That was dead wrong, and the ECB — which believed in the inflation threat and raised rates — clearly made a big mistake."
937053377,no,0.6685,"I ran my own version of their simulations for a hypothetical country — call it Osbornia — which starts with debt at 100 percent of GDP and a budget deficit that would, left to itself, be consistent with a stable debt ratio thanks to 2 percent growth and 2 percent inflation."
937056282,no,1,"Human beings just don’t handle the very long run well — call it hyperbolic discounting, call it bounded rationality, whatever, our brains are designed to cope with the ancestral savannah and not late-stage capitalist finance."
937053242,no,1,"There’s an extensive, mostly positive discussion of bank notes in Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations."
937056304,no,1,"In fact, if anything it finds that business investment has held up a bit better than one might have expected in the face of economic weakness: This is, interestingly, something I concluded a while back looking at U.S. data, during the height of the he’s-looking-at-me-funny era."
937056574,no,1,— and has been wrong year after year.
937052070,no,1,But both were followed by prolonged “jobless recoveries” that felt like continuing recessions.
937053868,no,1,"At the very least, you’d think he would have learned a lesson from the experience."
937054456,no,1,We are not talking about whether Greece will pay its debt.
937054142,no,1,Let me offer my own two short subjective lists.
937052397,no,1,"Also, and I think harder to forgive, is the way many commentators seem oblivious to how we got here."
937055326,no,1,And I am pinching myself at the realization that this seemingly whimsical and arcane discussion is turning out to have real policy significance.
937053375,no,1,"In part this is because a weaker economy shrinks revenues, offsetting a large part of the direct austerity."
937055327,no,1,Today’s employment report continued the pattern we’ve been seeing for a while.
937056404,no,0.6549,This would greatly encourage challengers to austerity and internal devaluation elsewhere.
937056936,no,1,"Now, it’s true that single-payer systems in other advanced countries are much cheaper than our health care system."
937052398,no,1,"Yes, we have large budget deficits — but those deficits have arisen mainly as the flip side of a collapse in private spending and borrowing."
937052554,no,0.6541,"The whole point of that paper was that when you’re up against the zero lower bound, it doesn’t matter how much money you print — not unless you credibly promise higher inflation."
937054024,no,1,"Still, it’s pretty striking just how fast the financial situation seems to be unraveling."
937052409,no,1,"It shouldn’t try to manipulate the interest rates of the free market, or get involved in business cycles at all."
937052536,no,1,"Kind of different, isn’t it?"
937055009,no,1,"For one thing, it attacks not just QE2, which was about to commence, but QE1 — the Fed’s intervention during the chaotic post-Lehman period — which is generally considered to have been quite effective."
937054308,no,1,In a sense the debt is an accounting fiction; it’s whatever the governments trying to dictate terms to Greece decide to say it is.
937052313,no,1,"Now we face the prospect of a prolonged period of near-zero short-term rates — I don’t see any reason for the Fed funds rate to rise for at least a year, and probably two — which should mean substantially lower long rates even if you expect yields eventually to rise back to 2005 levels."
937055610,no,1,"And Europe, which has a compact geography and the kind of shared institutions and culture (and transparency) that make access doable, is surely a better case than the diverse, sprawling group of countries involved in TPP."
937057045,no,1,But didn’t the Smoot-Hawley tariff cause the Great Depression?
937052298,no,0.6574,"Despite large deficits, the Federal government is able to borrow cheaply, at rates that are up from the early post-Lehman period, when market were pricing in a substantial probability of a second Great Depression, but well below the pre-crisis levels: Underlying these low rates is, in turn, the fact that overall borrowing by the nonfinancial sector hasn’t risen: the surge in government borrowing has in fact, less than offset a plunge in private borrowing."
937056545,no,0.6426,"Despite the overwhelming evidence that austerity has exactly the dire effects basic textbook macro says it will, they cling to belief in the confidence fairy."
937056345,no,0.6496,"It makes no sense, then, to claim that following the rule just so happens to be exactly what we need to avoid crises."
937053469,no,0.6458,"This is pretty close to the argument that we must have austerity, because stimulus might remove the incentive for structural reform that, you guessed it, gives businesses the confidence they need before deigning to produce recovery."
937057334,no,1,So I think that progressives should be cheering Trump on (which is why my secret committee has been orchestrating that conspiracy Cruz talks about.)
937054083,no,1,"Keynesians came into the Volcker disinflation — yes, it was mainly the Fed’s doing, not Reagan’s — with a standard, indeed textbook, model of what should happen."
937054724,no,1,"In a world that is short of demand, how, exactly, is structural reform that enhances the supply side (if it does) supposed to solve the problem?"
937057324,no,1,"Still, it’s something people think about, and I found myself trying to clarify things with a silly diagram."
937053344,no,1,When do the people of the afflicted economies say that they can bear no more?
937053536,no,0.6403,"The question is important because central banks may be able to reduce unemployment that is cyclic in nature, but not that which is structural."
937052999,no,1,"Mark Thoma sends us to John Cassidy on the absence of really new ideas in this crisis — largely because we didn’t need new ideas, all we needed for the most part was to remember things that we somehow forgot."
937052229,no,1,Here’s what I imagine Niall Ferguson was thinking: he was thinking of the interest rate as determined by the supply and demand for savings.
937054134,no,1,"I never got around to commenting on the infamous Economist list of influential economists; they’ve been given plenty of deserved grief, to which I needn’t add."
937052841,no,1,"For the Sams to do this, of course, the Janets must be prepared to dissave, to run down their assets."
937053029,no,1,"; people like Geithner who opposed stronger action were basing their position on gut feelings about confidence, not number-crunching."
937054004,no,1,"Hey, it worked for me."
937052316,no,1,"Well, we’ve seen enough of that sort of thing not to dismiss the possibility."
937052738,no,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, the man President Obama chose to co-chair his deficit commission: “This is a fakery,” Simpson said on Fox News."
937052555,no,1,"And of course, now we’re all Japanese."
937053177,no,1,"By now, the centrist dodge ought to be familiar."
937057158,no,1,So what are the people complaining about artificially low rates talking about?
937057281,no,1,What would they think would happen instead?
937053654,no,1,"In any case, this is more or less the state of the practical art, and I’m delighted to learn that he’s put it together."
937057314,no,1,"The BIS, however, wants governments as well as households to retrench — I’m kind of surprised that it doesn’t also call for everyone to run a trade surplus; it wants interest rates raised right away; and — in a clear sign that it isn’t being coherent — it includes a box declaring that deflation isn’t so bad, after all."
937057370,no,1,"Nor is China alone. "
937057342,no,1,"Attacks on immigrants are still the central theme of the Republican front-runner’s campaign, but he has opened a second front on trade deficits, which he asserts are being caused by the currency manipulation of other countries, especially China."
937053233,no,1,"Ryan basically proposes three big things: slashing Medicaid, cutting taxes on corporations and high-income people, and replacing Medicare with a drastically less well funded voucher system."
937053998,no,1,"People in that camp tuned out alternative views more than 30 years ago, so all they observe is their own repetitional universe."
937056310,no,1,"What it doesn’t say explicitly is that in using this procedure, it manages in passing both to refute a very widely held but false belief about deficits and to confirm a highly controversial Keynesian proposition."
937052648,no,1,"And everyone has just seen the punishment for too much debt; asking others to run up debt to help fix the problem, even though it’s right, is unavoidably a tough sell."
937052953,no,0.656,"Meanwhile, people deciding how to allocate their wealth are making tradeoffs between money and bonds."
937055742,no,1,"Geometrically, you can represent equilibrium in a three-good economy in a space defined by the two relative prices."
937052532,no,1,So what’s the context?
937053926,no,1,We need a term for beliefs based on reports that have been superseded; maybe fossils instead of zombies.
937057223,no,1,"Still, the trade dispute is a revealing fight, on both sides."
937057061,no,1,"For those new to the term, the natural rate is a standard economic concept dating back a century; it’s the rate of interest at which the economy is neither depressed and deflating nor overheated and inflating."
937052981,no,1,"The thing is, all it took to get this right was understanding IS-LM, and taking it seriously."
937057263,no,1,Nobody has ever produced a coherent story about how Fed policy can drive interest rates below their natural level without inflationary effects.
937057131,no,1,"… Crowding out, overheating and rising interest rates are also not likely to be a problem as there is no competition for funds from the private sector."
937057067,no,1,That’s more speculative.
937057185,no,1,"These past few years have been lean times in many respects — but they’ve been boom years for agonizingly dumb, pound-your-head-on-the-table economic fallacies."
937057053,no,1,"For years those of us pointing to low interest rates as evidence that fiscal scolds were all wrong met, over and over again, one stock answer: those low rates were meaningless, because the Fed was buying up government bonds and keeping rates artificially low."
937056773,no,1,He’s completely right about the economics.
937052962,no,1,"First of all, it helps you avoid fallacies like the notion that because savings must equal investment, government spending cannot lead to a rise in total spending – which right away puts us above the level of argument that famous Chicago professors somehow find convincing."
937052439,no,0.6585,"So what we’ve got here is an assertion that bad things will happen if you do certain things, without either any evidence to that effect or any explanation of why those things should happen."
937053882,no,0.6448,And inflation did indeed come down — eventually.
937056867,no,1,Even deep voodoo isn’t enough to turn that number positive; so much for any notion that Republicans cared about fiscal responsibility.
937055185,no,0.6853,"And MIT students developed a style that was either wonderfully pragmatic or disgustingly lacking in rigor, depending on your tastes: models derived from microfoundations were always the goal, but when observed experience was clearly at odds with what the models predicted, you’d just impose realistic behavior and leave its ultimate explanation as a project for the future."

937056749,no,1,One more thing: I was especially annoyed at the BIS’s claim that we now know that pre-crisis estimates of potential output were greatly overstated; they mention the US in the mid-200s as an example.

937052680,no,1,"Similarly, you could argue that a sufficiently large fall in wages could restore full employment now — but it would have to be a very large wage decline, and the positive effects would kick in only after deflation had first driven just about every debtor in the economy into bankruptcy."

937053235,no,1,All the claims of major deficit reduction therefore rest on the magic asterisks.

937053354,no,1,"Menzie actually analyzes the process of internal devaluation, though not by that name, and offers us the following figure and caption: So over time gradual deflation (or deflation relative to trading partners) increases competitiveness, leading to recovery toward full employment; this implies a period of above-normal growth and, implicitly, above normal growth in exports as well."

937053278,no,1,"Props to Eddie Lazear; he’s a loyal Republican who’s been saying a lot of things I consider totally wrong lately, but his paper for Jackson Hole (pdf) is a professional, well-done piece that offers little aid and comfort to his political allies."

937052676,no,1,"It seemed obvious that there were big problems when people had large foreign-currency debt: a depreciation of the rupiah, say, worsened balance sheets by causing the domestic-current value of debt to explode, and was probably contractionary overall."
937053238,no,1,"Aside from revealing just how much of a Rand fanboy Ryan is — urban legend, my foot — this is interesting because that 23 paragraph speech isn’t just a call for the gold standard; it’s a call for eliminating paper money and going back to gold coins."

937053276,no,0.708,"The problem it creates for conservatives is not that it doesn’t work, but that it does — which is a challenge to their philosophy."
937053171,no,1,Simon Wren-Lewis says something quite similar to my own view about the trouble with macroeconomics: it’s mostly political.
937053350,no,1,"Talking to people, and also reading what comes across the threshold, it occurs to me that there’s widespread misunderstanding of what a more or less Keynesian view of Europe’s problems actually implies."
937052696,no,1,"But in reality, scenario A, the low-inflation scenario, is vastly worse for Spain — for two reasons."
937054453,no,0.6653,"It’s important to understand that this is not a verdict on the new Greek government, or at any rate only the new Greek government; it’s a judgment that the risk of no agreement, and a disorderly breakdown of the whole process, is high."
937056384,no,1,Both find that monetary policy does indeed matter.
937057082,no,1,"In particular, when you see reports on monetary disputes, you often see characterizations of what the Fed’s right-wing critics have been saying that go something like this, in the WaPo: Among the criticisms: The Fed was keeping interest rates artificially low and fueling speculative bubbles."
937056807,no,1,"But events since the crisis provide a lot more evidence, just as they do on fiscal multipliers."
937055299,no,1,The Bank for International Settlements remains tight-money central.

937053841,no,1,"We had just had the worst financial crisis since, um, the 1930s."
937056366,no,1,Who would have suspected such a thing?
937052341,no,0.6597,"Yet the Alesina-Ardagna analysis doesn’t make that distinction; Japan in the 90s, which was up against the zero bound, is treated the same as a batch of countries in the 70s and 80s, when interest rates were quite high."
937054605,no,1,"And this in turn suggests that if we’re looking for the key to European problems, it lies in Germany’s beggar-they-neighbor relative wage deflation — which is indeed a point made by economists like Francesco Saraceno."
937053987,no,1,"By the way, the field most in the news — business cycle macroeconomics, aka economic fluctuations — can give you a misleading impression of how the profession in general works, precisely because macro is divided into hostile camps."
937057004,no,1,One item from that poll that seems to have surprised reporters: There’s no enthusiasm gap — it’s just different forms of enthusiasm.
937052865,no,1,I have often found the economic analyses coming out of Pimco deeply enlightening.

937056774,no,1,"Monetary policy, in which the central bank buys and sells securities to change the monetary base, is nothing at all like price controls."
937056424,no,1,"For Finns, the great depression they remember is the slump at the beginning of the 1990s, driven by a combination of a bursting housing bubble and the collapse of the Soviet Union next door."
937055593,no,0.6755,"In part, I believe, this reflects globaloney: talking about international trade sounds glamorous and forward-thinking, so everyone wants to make that the centerpiece of their remarks."
937056307,no,1,"Loosely speaking, it looks for episodes of weak growth that are clearly caused by other factors, so that it can be sure that falling investment is an effect rather than a cause."
937053035,no,1,"Now, Yglesias has some fun with Cochrane’s violation of the extended version of Godwin’s Law, which says that the first person to mention either Weimar or Zimbabwe in a discussion of current issues loses."
937054030,no,1,"Venezuela then, like Russia now, was a petro-economy which had consistently run external surpluses."
937052997,no,1,But that’s apparently off the table.
937056025,no,1,"Second, we’re still talking about very hard fighting — as far as I can tell, precisely because Grant was aggressive about moving even in dubious weather."
937055335,no,1,"But it’s not very useful as a guide to short- and medium-term policy, because we do not have any good idea of where that lower bound lies."
937055152,no,1,"For example, his attempt to refute something I wrote about Kansas ended up being mainly a story about why Stephen can’t count, which presumably wasn’t his intention."
937053358,no,0.6538,"I guess it could slightly accelerate the adjustment by driving unemployment even higher; but if the biggest problem is actually one of maintaining social and political cohesion, which seems to be the case, it’s actually counterproductive even for the creditors."
937052597,no,1,"Yes, that will in a way be rewarding their past excesses – but economics is not a morality play."

937056640,no,0.6914,"They had seized the moment when people took their models seriously to loudly and aggressively declare that Keynesianism of any form was total nonsense, that everything macroeconomists had done in the previous four decades was worthless."
937053406,no,0.6843,"And while I am not infallible, I have done a lot of economic modeling in my time; if you think that I’ve made an elementary logical error, you might want to check your reasoning very carefully before going with it."
937056435,no,0.6805,"As Tony Yates points out, however, there’s nothing puzzling at all about what happened; it’s exactly what you should expect when interest rates are near zero."
937057012,no,0.645,"His proposed 35 percent tariff-like penalties would instigate a trade war and that would raise prices for consumers, kill our export jobs and lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all stripes to flee America."

937056395,no,0.6781,The former probably recognizes a real problem — Greece probably can’t deliver what it has promised pensioners — but why should this be an issue over and above the general question of the primary surplus.
937052487,no,1,"How much would that accomplish now, when even the 2-year yield is only 0.67 percent?"
937053189,no,1,"The idea of the natural rate, that there was no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, was very much disliked by people like Jim Tobin, but accepted by nearly everyone after the experience of the 1970s."
937054437,no,0.6795,"Greece has been running a primary surplus since 2013, and according to its agreements with the troika it’s supposed to run a surplus of 4.5 percent of GDP for many years to come."

937056347,no,1,It dices!
937052138,no,0.6735,This really does look like a plan that falls well short of what advocates of strong stimulus were hoping for — and it seems as if that was done in order to win Republican votes.
937053542,no,0.661,"Goldman Sachs (no link) looks at unemployment in the “sand states” that had the biggest housing bubbles versus the rest of the country; it looks like this: So the states that took the biggest hit have recovered faster than the rest of the country, which is what you’d expect if it was all cycle, not structural change."
937053252,no,1,"As I pointed out a few days ago, CBO did not score the policy provisions in the Ryan plan; there wasn’t remotely enough detail for a comprehensive assessment, and they didn’t do a partial of what was specified."

937055179,no,1,"At MIT, which had played such a large role in bringing Keynes to America, there was a lot of searching and self-doubt — my classmates would sometimes say things like “The rational expectations guys were right about stagflation, so might they be right about the rest?” There was almost a hint of an inferiority complex."
937052091,no,1,Calculated Risk says much of what I’d say about housing and the prospects for quick economic recovery.
937055622,no,1,But are they really US firms in any meaningful sense?
937057287,no,0.6677,"And deficits that must be monetized are one way to make that happen (as they were in the 1930s, when Japan had a very successful comeback from the Great Depression, aside from that invading China thing.)"

937056700,no,1,"As Keynes and Hicks explained three generations ago, this is a completely inadequate story — because it misses the reality that the level of income isn’t fixed, and changes in income affect the supply and demand for funds."
937052895,no,0.669,"As long as we were in the liquidity trap, interest rates would stay low despite large budget deficits."

937054092,no,1,So were Keynesian economists feeling amazed and dismayed by the events of the 1980s?
937056157,no,1,Shouldn’t it be impossible to have secular stagnation in just one country?
937053628,no,1,So what’s wrong with this pretty picture?
937056721,no,1,"So bankers keep demanding higher rates, and inventing stories about why that would make sense despite low inflation."
937053433,no,1,"The scene at Appomattox — aristocratic Lee in his dress uniform surrendering to disheveled, unimpressive-looking Grant — represents for me the coming of the modern world."

937052970,no,1,Budget deficits shift IS to the right; in the liquidity trap that has no effect on the interest rate.
937056037,no,1,This would seem to point to fundamental weakness in private demand.
937052434,no,0.6516,"And rationally, stimulus spending shouldn’t change that view: with the long-term real interest rate well below 2 percent, current borrowing has only a trivial effect on the long-run state of the budget."

937053306,no,1,"But now, after the Fed has finally moved a bit in the direction of doing something about the Lesser Depression, Mitt Romney – supposedly advised by Mankiw among others – is outraged: [T]he American economy doesn’t need more artificial and ineffective measures."

937055481,no,0.6781,"They make a forecast for the exchange rate, then run this through some set of trade elasticities to get the effects on trade and hence on GDP."

937054031,no,1,"But it was nonetheless a vulnerable debtor, because all those external surpluses and more had in effect been recycled into overseas assets of the corrupt elite."
937057029,no,0.641,"But, you know, protectionism was the only reason he gave for believing that Trump would cause a recession, which I think is kind of telling: the GOP’s supposedly well-informed, responsible adult, trying to save the party, can’t get basic economics right at the one place where economics is central to his argument."
937057126,no,1,And as I wrote: So what does government borrowing do?
937055750,no,0.6919,"If we assume that all three are gross substitutes – the most natural though not inevitable assumption – we get Figure 1: We can make this more familiar by putting the interest rate – which moves inversely to the price of bonds – on the axis, which flips the figure upside down, and by removing one of the markets; what we get is Figure 2, which is basically IS-LM: Wait, you say, isn’t IS-LM usually presented as a model of output, not the price level?"

937053793,no,1,So what happens to the currency?
937052385,no,1,"What happens in a foreign currency intervention is that the central bank buys foreign securities while selling domestic securities — that is, the Bank of Israel was doing, as a deliberate policy, exactly what we’re supposed to fear the Chinese doing."
937055336,no,1,I very much hope that Fed staff remembers the 1990s.
937053346,no,1,"Also, while Greece has long since ceased to be the epicenter, things seem to be breaking down there too."
937054726,no,1,"For people who are supposedly so serious, the Very Serious seem remarkably casual about thinking things through."

937052331,no,1,"Anyway, I was wondering: it’s my impression that the same people now warning about the alleged Treasury bubble dismissed warnings about the housing bubble."
937053362,no,1,"On the monetary front, the Bank of England raised interest rates to 7 percent in 1920 to support the return to the prewar parity, which—coupled with the ensuing deflation—delivered extraordinarily high real rates."

937056930,no,1,My column and Bernie Sanders’ plan crossed in the mail.
937052499,no,1,The Fed deserves to be chastised for not doing more; that’s not the same as saying that the Fed should be the only target of criticism.
937052345,no,1,"So I turn to the appendix table in Alesina/Ardagna, and find that 1995 isn’t there — whereas 2005 and 2007, which I’ve never heard of as stimulus years, are."

937056330,no,1,"But there’s still the matter of self-awareness and self-control — the ability to set limits, to avoid the temptation to spend your life claiming that the insights you had decades ago were the final word on the subject, maybe even the final word on all subjects."
937053348,no,0.6548,"But he can’t make internal devaluation work on his own, and he can’t save Europe if its leaders continue to think that gratuitous infliction of pain is sound policy."

937054428,no,1,(No bargaining if the troika basically says no concessions.)
937054863,no,1,But the rise in demand initially raises rates in our country but not abroad.

937053012,no,1,"And there are good, well-understood reasons for this wider mandate."
937052497,no,0.6502,"So it’s not safe to assume that the Fed can, for example, hit any target for nominal GDP that it chooses."
937057411,no,1,"Part of the answer is that workers in Denmark, two-thirds of whom are unionized, still have a lot of bargaining power."

937053974,no,1,"Not by having a chair at a major school; that helps your visibility, but doesn’t protect you from being perceived as none too bright (in fact, even past work doesn’t do that — you hear younger economists wondering how that guy wrote those papers.)"

937052408,no,1,"The Fed should just maintain zero inflation, or go on the gold standard."

937056549,no,1,It’s as Keynes said: Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.
937056339,no,1,It dices!
937052801,no,0.6598,"If you believe that it is obvious that rates will spike as soon as QE2 ends, you have to ask why investors aren’t moving out of US debt now in anticipation; you don’t have to believe in efficient markets to believe that totally obvious gains or losses will be anticipated."
937053674,no,1,"So, I’m going to disagree with both propositions."
937053379,no,1,Output ends up 6.5 percent below the baseline; debt looks like this: Why does this matter?
937055608,no,1,"I’ve estimated that “hyperglobalization” – the expansion of world trade to unprecedented levels since 1990 – has added about 5 percent to world incomes; but that’s the combination of everything: containerization, drastic trade liberalization in developing countries, the internet."
937053939,no,1,"It reminds the audience that being rich doesn’t mean that you know what you’re talking about; it also provides other rich people some incentive to think before they speak, and maybe even do some homework before preaching to the rest of us."
937057175,no,1,"In fact, a lot of people predicted that this would happen in mid-2011, when QE2 came to an end — and lost a lot of money as a result."
937056259,no,1,"If you read his remarks, you’ll see that he was as sharp — and good humored — as ever."
937056553,no,1,"Now, many of us took on similar claims in the UK – and quickly noted that a large part of the story behind the resumption of British growth in 2013-2014 was actually a pause in fiscal consolidation."
937056741,no,1,"So you might have expected the BIS to ask why it was so wrong, and reconsider its policy recommendations."
937052898,no,1,4
937055733,no,1,"The basic macroeconomic framework that we all should have turned to, the framework that is still there in most textbooks, performed spectacularly well: it made strong predictions that people who didn’t know that framework found completely implausible, and those predictions were vindicated."
937052420,no,1,Warsh isn’t an especially bad example — but that’s the point: this is what Serious People sound like these days.
937053567,no,1,"You see, those dastardly officials are paying interest on reserves – a hefty 0.25 percent – and this has led to something totally unexpected: The US Federal Reserve Board has pumped out trillions of dollars of reserves, but never have so many reserves produced so little monetary growth."
937053679,no,1,"But my main thought, reading Davies’s piece, was that the belief that trade must always expand much faster than output, and that there’s something wrong if it doesn’t, doesn’t stand up to careful scrutiny."

937056027,no,1,"The battle of Dinwiddie Court House was a nail-biting fighting retreat on the Union side, with heavy casualties all around."
937052501,no,1,But I’m not sure whether readers will understand quite what the puzzle is — and they certainly wouldn’t gather from the article that there’s actually a literature about this puzzle.
937054578,no,0.6908,"Up until now, the euro has proved very durable, largely thanks to the point Barry Eichengreen emphasized: any country that even hinted at the possibility of leaving would face the mother of all bank runs."
937052901,no,1,"On the last, nominal wages have proved much more resistant to falling than I expected; I should have taken the downward nominal rigidity notion much more seriously."
937054465,no,1,"If the creditors do play hardball, their leverage does not come from the ability to refuse new loans to the Greek government."
937052541,no,1,That’s typical of the whole argument.
937052148,no,1,"That said, the report is written in such a way as to make it hard to figure out exactly what’s in the plan."

937054100,no,1,Simon Wren-Lewis asks how good British economic recovery — which is being touted as a wonderful success story — really has been.
937053152,no,1,3
937052959,no,1,"This means that like loanable funds, liquidity preference doesn’t determine the interest rate per se; it defines a set of possible combinations of the interest rate and GDP – the LM curve."
937055587,no,1,"I don’t think the proposal is likely to be the terrible, worker-destroying pact some progressives assert, but it doesn’t look like a good thing either for the world or for the United States, and you have to wonder why the Obama administration, in particular, would consider devoting any political capital to getting this through."
937057110,no,1,I’d just add two points.

937055896,no,1,"Time drifted away — it was 10:10, then 10:20, the audience was growing restive, and I felt terrible for the performers, who seemed to be losing their chance to perform."
937056900,no,0.6751,"I was especially annoyed at this paragraph: In the past, I have called this the problem of “snowbank macroeconomics:” just as a driver of a car stuck in a snowbank can press the gas pedal as hard as they want and not make much progress, it seems to me that we are in a situation where monetary and fiscal stimulus that has been extremely high by historical standards since about 2008 has had a much smaller effect on output and inflation than would have been expected before the Great Recession."
937053796,no,0.6576,"As I said, this isn’t the real reason currencies fluctuate so much, but no matter."
937056513,no,1,"I’m still working this one out, but at best it makes austerity successful at reducing the debt ratio in the very long run — think decades, not years."
937054293,no,1,"Larry has had his time running the world, but right now he sounds exactly like me: “Deflation and secular stagnation are the threats of our time."
937052390,no,0.6697,Dean Baker gets upset by this line in today’s very useful Keith Bradsher article: China is the biggest buyer of Treasury bonds at a time when the United States has record budget deficits and needs China to keep buying those bonds to finance American debt.
937055586,no,1,"Not to keep you in suspense, I’m thumbs down."
937054299,no,1,"It’s an uncertain world, but why do those in office come down on one side of that uncertainty, while those outside come down on the other?"
937057207,no,0.6669,Banks are largely in the business of borrowing short and lending long; anything that compresses the spread between short rates and long rates is likely to be bad for their profits.
937056851,no,1,Government is the root of all evil!
937054139,no,1,But there’s another important factor.
937056486,no,0.6543,"It can pursue reforms that might make it more competitive, but anyone promising dramatic, quick results has no idea what he is talking about."
937057016,no,1,Think about the arithmetic (which has a well-known liberal bias).
937052754,no,1,But why?
937053581,no,1,"Instead, the usual suspects stick their heads in the sand and pretend that they have been right all along."
937053569,no,1,So the money supply broadly defined hasn’t taken off – a complete surprise!
937056615,no,1,"McCain the myth is who they see, and keep putting on TV."
937053659,no,0.6806,"The reason I’m hesitating a bit before simply declaring trade the culprit is the issue of causation, and the related issue of whether those deficits are likely to persist."
937056264,no,1,"What Brad argues are two propositions that run very much counter to the prevailing wisdom, especially among Very Serious People."
937055875,no,1,Why?
937053329,no,1,But the root remains the balance of payments/cost problem.
937056775,no,1,"Furthermore, we have a very clear model that tells us what interest rates would be in the absence of distortions and rigidities, the Wicksellian natural rate — the rate of interest consistent with an economy subject neither to inflationary overheating nor deflationary excess supply."
937054715,no,1,Technology hasn’t retrogressed; institutions haven’t suddenly gotten far worse.
937057190,no,1,Let me count the ways.
937054128,no,1,"But one form of argument that is really illegitimate is to comb through the data, pick out outliers, and claiming that the existence of these outliers — because stuff does, in fact, happen — disproves Keynesian logic."
937056934,no,1,"Despite imposing large middle-class taxes, his “gesture toward a future plan”, as Ezra puts it, relies on the assumption of huge cost savings."
937052846,no,1,Then we have a problem.
937053158,no,1,Aid on that scale is inconceivable in Europe as currently constituted.
937053883,no,1,"But along the way there were deep recessions and soaring unemployment, which went on much longer than you could justify with any plausible story about the monetary shock being unanticipated."
937055025,no,0.6797,"I do, however, have a pretty good idea of what Greece is asking for on the fiscal side, and it might be useful to talk about the arithmetic behind that position."
937053727,no,0.7005,"But that’s not the case for Britain; clearly, IS shifts right."
937053097,no,1,Did the behavior of real exchange rates — relative price levels expressed in a common currency — change?
937052349,no,1,And their results look pretty Keynesian.
937055160,no,1,"Not long ago I received a copy of MIT and the Transformation of American Economics, a collection of essays on how American economics became model- and math-oriented after World War II, and of the special role played by the department Paul Samuelson built."
937053194,no,0.6923,"But then there’s the other side – freshwater, equilibrium, more or less classical macro."
937057282,no,1,"Not default — Japan doesn’t have to default, because its debts are in its own currency."
937056040,no,1,That’s a good point.
937054148,no,1,"Who gets cited by, say, Republican governors seeking authority for their tax cuts, or published on a regular basis on conservative opinion pages?"
937057224,no,1,"Actually, a bit of background: establishment Republicans may talk free trade, but they are if anything more protectionist than Democrats in practice (although neither party is seriously protectionist these days.)"
937056336,no,1,"(Maybe it is optimal, but it’s far from proved, and there’s certainly no consensus.)"
937052658,no,1,Why?
937053175,no,1,And there’s another parallel: many of those decrying the conflict within macro without facing up to the real sources of that conflict are playing the same unhelpful role being played by fanatical centrists within the punditocracy.
937052668,no,1,"As the late Rudi Dornbusch used to say, it takes two nominals to make a real, and in Modigliani it actually does all come down to M/w."
937053185,no,1,"(Some devotees of Keynes claim that people like me aren’t really Keynesians – and while there are some serious grounds for the charge, part of the reason is precisely that we’ve treated Keynes as an inspiration to be modified in the face of evidence rather than as holy writ)."
937052824,no,1,So let me repost in its entirety my take on the balance-sheet recession issue.
937052493,no,1,There are other things the Fed can do; they would help; uncertainty about how much they would help shouldn’t be a reason not to try.
937056750,no,1,But we know no such thing.
937053584,no,1,"In the late 60s, Friedman and Phelps warned of the risk of stagflation, and were vindicated in the 1970s."
937052757,no,1,"Both the phrase and the subject have gone out of fashion — but it’s still an important issue, and arguably now more than ever."
937057122,no,1,"Um, how about Pimco’s own chief economist, Paul McCulley?"
937053111,no,1,The usual one is to claim that Keynesians predicted great results from the Obama stimulus (which I very noisily did not).
937053935,no,1,"Let me quote from a wonderful essay by Molly Ivins (read the whole thing): Satire is a weapon, and it can be quite cruel."
937054606,no,1,One thing is for sure: this chart says nothing whatsoever about the role of “anti-business” policies.
937052831,no,1,"After all, to a first approximation debt is money we owe to ourselves – yes, the US has debt to China etc., but that’s not at the heart of the problem."
937053947,no,1,"I actually see five arguments out there — two (including the actual Ricardian equivalence argument) completely and embarrassingly wrong on logical grounds, three more that aren’t logical nonsense but fly in the face of the evidence."
937054750,no,1,"Time for a bit of analytical thinking, which is good for the soul in any case."
937054427,no,1,How should we think about the bargaining that may or may not now take place between the new Greek government and the troika?
937054301,no,1,And I worry that this is what is happening to the insiders.
937052509,no,1,"Prices fell sharply at the beginning of the Great Depression, when the real economy was collapsing; but they began rising again when the economy began to recover, even though there was still a huge negative output gap."
937052866,no,1,"And in 2009-2010 the firm won big by betting, correctly, on interest rates staying low."
937052568,no,0.6784,It cannot respond to the opportunities which industry may offer.
937053763,no,0.671,"And since the forward premium is basically equal to the interest-rate differential, this in turn means inferring Japanese inflation expectations as equal to the US TIPS spread minus the difference between US and Japanese rates."

937053440,no,1,"Nothing about our current situation, except maybe the absence of outright deflation, is at all surprising or mysterious."
937053873,no,1,And so that’s what must have happened.
937057330,no,0.6803,"n each case, the expected awfulness is the product of the probability of election versus the awfulness if elected, i.e., the area of a rectangle whose base is the probability and whose height is the awfulness:"
937055762,no,1,"What we already have here is an understanding that there isn’t that kind of clean separation, that money can affect interest rates and spending affect output."
937054046,no,1,But I had my road-to-Damascus moment — or more accurately road-to-Tokyo moment — back in 1998.
937056778,no,1,It’s important to realize that we’re not just talking about monetary ignoramuses like Rand Paul and George Will.
937053463,no,1,"As he notes, the day after he wrote that post, Steven Pearlstein of the Washington Post made exactly that argument for austerity."
937052101,no,0.6518,CR says 2009; I say 2010.
937052411,no,1,"The attitude on display from quite a few economists bears a distinct resemblance to Depression-era liquidationism, as described in Brad DeLong’s excellent but somehow never published book on the economic history of the 20th century: … the unwillingness to use policy to prop up the economy during the slide into the Depression was backed by a large chorus, and approved by the most eminent economists."
937053318,no,1,"Basically, they’ve thrown out 80 years of economic analysis and evidence because it doesn’t fit their ideological preconceptions, and they’re resorting to dubious metaphors – “sugar high” and all that – as a substitute for clear thinking."
937056914,no,1,"Where does anyone get the notion that it’s a problem requiring structural reform, or even necessarily a problem structural reform can solve?"
937057157,no,1,"But that hasn’t been happening; yes, there’s a slight uptick in some U.S. inflation measures, but nothing out there that suggests an interest rate that is way too low in this macroeconomic sense."
937054275,no,1,"We don’t have access to different facts; we don’t, in any fundamental sense, have different economic models."
937052233,no,1,Why?
937052473,no,1,"In a way, the problem with Bernanke’s speech was that he made increasing demand and fighting deflation sound too easy."
937056785,no,1,Nor did it cut it for traditional conservatives.
937056016,no,0.671,"And someone who is careless, cynical, or both, could easily take the faster growth of these states as evidence that conservative economic policies work."
937053545,no,1,"Yet somehow, it’s clear, Beltway groupthink has arrived at the opposite conclusion — so much so that the actual economic consensus on this issue wasn’t even represented on the Newshour."
937056323,no,1,"We have EITC and food stamps; TANF, the successor to old-fashioned welfare, is a shadow of the former program."
937055039,no,0.6648,"Say μ = 1.3 and τ=0.4, both more or less in the middle of the evidence; then higher spending would reduce the primary surplus by less than half the initial spending rise."
937057194,no,1,"Beyond that, let’s talk about the economics."
937054279,no,1,"On the whole, it seems less likely for the outsiders, although it’s true that the Keynesian econoblogs form what amounts to a tight ongoing discussion group that could be doing some amplification of its own: But if you ask me, there’s a worrying complacency among the insiders right now, and I would urge them to consider the potential consequences if they’re wrong."
937052196,no,0.6597,"Loanable funds says that the interest rate is determined by the supply of and demand for saving; Keynes pointed out that the supply of saving is endogenous, depending on the level of output."
937055604,no,1,What about TPP?
937052175,no,1,"But the economy overall does not care if you buy a car, or if you lend money to a company that buys a forklift."
937056646,no,1,"And because they never do the simple version, they don’t realize (or at any rate don’t admit to themselves) how fundamentally silly the whole thing sounds, how much it’s at odds with lived experience."
937054155,no,1,"The right lacks heavyweight economists with independent reputations partly because they are hard to find, but also because it doesn’t want them."
937057086,no,1,The people who gathered at the anti-Jackson-Hole event weren’t warning about bubbles and too-big-to-fail.
937053181,no,1,The macroeconomics equivalent looks like this: a concerned writer or speaker on economics bemoans the state of the field and argues that what we really need are macroeconomists who are willing to approach the subject with an open mind and change their views if the evidence doesn’t support their model.
937053656,no,1,"I don’t disagree, although there are some issues I need to think through."
937056365,no,0.661,"So Montier offers a lot of evidence that interest rates move a lot, which isn’t news to anyone, and then one argument he apparently thinks is a big thing economists don’t know — that business investment is basically unaffected by interest rates."
937056355,no,1,So you want to think of the economic environment for yesterday’s election as being roughly comparable to that facing Clinton in 1996.
937055459,no,1,I’ve also taken to wearing a serious heart-rate monitor when doing cardio.
937053056,no,1,What went wrong with the economics profession?
937057250,no,1,"As Brad says, the required rate of return on safe assets and the marginal product of capital are separated by a major wedge."
937057254,no,1,"A few years back, rising commodity prices and a flood of money into emerging markets were proof that low rates were dangerously inflationary and must be hiked."
937054450,no,1,"The point is that while issues of debt relief are in large part arguments about accounting fiction, the question of how large a primary surplus Greece runs is real and has powerful implications for the economic outlook."
937055315,no,1,"In both the Soltas and Keohane pieces, there’s a discussion of storage costs for currency, which are not as trivial as one might have assumed."
937052817,no,1,"What that means is that while the Fed should be doing more, so should other actors: unconventional monetary policy should go along with fiscal stimulus."
937052708,no,1,"And yes, I have a model."
937052526,no,1,That’s basically the thrust of Mort Zuckerman’s op-ed accusing Obama of “demonizing” business.
937055864,no,1,"We’re all doing a lot of head-scratching lately about negative rates, but still, it’s clear that there’s something like a floor, so that the picture looks something like Figure 3: And that in turn says that once you hit that flat section – once you are in a liquidity trap – the rules change."
937053875,no,1,"I’ve been giving various talks and fireside chats here in Oxford, and one thing I keep coming back to is the pivotal role of the 1980s in the development of economic thought."
937052967,no,0.657,"At the margin, then, money is just being held as a store of value, and changes in the money supply have no effect."
937053010,no,1,I was struck by some of what Sims had to say.
937053148,no,1,"OK, a crude calculation: 1."
937052485,no,1,But I always felt than Ben was overstating the effectiveness of such purchases.
937053775,no,1,"Over at the Economix blog, Binyamin Appelbaum has a post about Stan Fischer’s role in the early development of New Keynesian macroeconomics."
937056039,no,1,So Bernanke argues that what Summers sees as evidence of secular stagnation actually reflects the global savings glut.
937053950,no,1,"No, it isn’t — and it was the remarkable fact that prominent economists were saying things like this, as if none of the debates of the 1930s had happened, that led me to proclaim a Dark Age of macroeconomics."
937057390,no,1,And there’s a reason for that difference.
937056977,no,0.6597,So nobody should be surprised that a candidate who appears to be disregarding the analysis that led to these positions is coming in for some criticism.
937054056,no,1,"And as a result, monetary traction is far from obvious."
937054459,no,1,2
937052529,no,0.6893,He was supposed to be seeking the support of the business community for a doubling of exports over the next five years.
937055478,no,0.6507,"What we actually see is almost three times that move, suggesting that the main driver here is the perception of permanent, or at any rate very long term European weakness."
937053686,no,0.6403,There’s no reason trade couldn’t be the same way.
937052932,no,1,What would have posed an intellectual puzzle would have been a rapid bounceback to full employment.
937056382,no,1,"Beyond that, the general proposition that money matters also rests on a lot of careful empirical work — in fact, on two styles of careful work."
937056582,no,1,But in terms of the underlying dynamics that makes no difference.
937053041,no,1,It’s not “impossible” but it’s a logistical and political nightmare.
937055186,no,0.6765,"Rudi’s overshooting model — rational expectations in the currency market, but ad hoc price stickiness in the good market — was the classic example; my own liquidity trap analysis, using rational expectations to think about demand and money, but assuming short-run rigidity to get real effects, was very much in the same tradition."
937056036,no,1,"We experienced the mother of all housing bubbles, fueled by a huge, unsustainable rise in household debt – yet all we got was a fairly unimpressive expansion by historical standards, and little if any inflationary overheating."
937056709,no,1,"Eighty years of hard economic thinking, and seven years of overwhelming confirmation of that hard thinking, have made no dent in their worldview."
937052965,no,1,In that case the picture looks like this: Why is the LM curve flat at zero?
937056467,no,1,Indeed.
937056600,no,1,Pundit centrism in modern America is a strange thing.
937053605,no,0.6405,"After all, if building aircraft carriers saved the economy in 1941, and defenses against imaginary aliens would save the economy in 2013, it’s not clear why real aircraft carriers have the opposite effect."
937054050,no,1,So I set out to show the point with a minimalist New Keynesian model; link to the little paper I wrote here.
937056668,no,1,Now what?
937054755,no,0.6672,"It looks like this: We can think of demand as being determined by an IS curve, with real spending higher the lower the interest rate."
937054119,no,1,"And they look like this (bear in mind that these are percentage changes, so you can’t read the slope of a trend line as a multiplier): Does this picture make you think that Keynesian economics is nonsense?"
937057169,no,0.6689,"Dean Baker is exercised over Hiatt’s evident longing for a financial crisis to get action on the policies he believes are necessary to avoid an, um, financial crisis; indeed, Hiatt is following in the inglorious footsteps of Alan Greenspan, who declared almost three years ago that the failure of interest rates and inflation to soar was “regrettable”, rather than being an indication that his model of the economy was wrong."
937054282,no,0.696,"On the other hand, that in turn isn’t as much of a coincidence as it might seem, because there was a big financial conference here, and the set of economists who get invited to such things isn’t that extensive."
937055470,no,1,"Such effects can be offset with interest rate changes if you’re not at the zero almost lower bound, but we are."
937053310,no,0.6641,Milton Friedman – who thought he had liberated conservatism from this kind of nonsense –must be spinning in his grave.
937055734,no,1,And the framework in question – basically John Hicks’s interpretation of John Maynard Keynes – was very much the natural way to think about the issues facing advanced countries after 2008.
937056665,no,1,(Nobody takes just one bite out of a cherry.)
937056263,no,1,"Instead, however, Brad has come up with what I believe are seriously new ideas — enough so that I want to do two posts, following different lines of thought he suggests."
937053891,no,0.6677,"Ezra tries to get us to appreciate just how good the Obamacare news has been with a thought experiment: Imagine taking a time machine back to 2010 and telling Republicans in Congress, who were arguing that the CBO was wildly underestimating Obamacare’s cost, that the law would be cheaper than predicted and, at least in the states that accepted its Medicaid dollars, cover more people than the Congressional Budget Office thought."
937053146,no,1,"Florida, however, has its retirement and much of its health care paid for from Washington."
937056728,no,0.6615,"Like everyone, the bankers no doubt are able to persuade themselves that what’s good for them is good for America and the world; more alarmingly, they may be able to persuade officials who should know better."
937057085,no,1,"Um, no."
937056535,no,1,But the free fall ended quite soon after the peso was devalued.

937056893,no,1,One of my long-running gripes about much discussion of current economic issues is about what I consider the long-run dodge.
937053551,no,1,and dubbed this view an “atrophied and rigid caricature” of the quantity theory.
937053262,no,1,"There was a time, not long ago, when Republicans — whatever you might think of their other ideas — were part of the mainstream consensus on monetary policy."
937056474,no,0.6912,"So more adjustment is needed, right?"
937053156,no,1,And it’s very big.
937054154,no,1,"So in trying to understand where the Milton Friedmans of yore have gone, you want to look at the demand side."
937054887,no,1,"All that’s on the table is a reduction in the primary surplus — that is, a reduction in Greek payments on existing debt."
937055585,no,1,The subject was the Trans-Pacific Partnership; slides for my talk are here.
937054286,no,1,"It’s always funny when people paint me as some kind of wild Marxist, with views on monetary and fiscal policy completely outside the mainstream; I may write forcefully, but on the substance there’s usually very little difference between what I say and what my ultra-respectable former schoolmates say."
937053009,no,1,"On Monday night we had a panel discussion of the euro crisis at Princeton — me, Chris Sims, Hyun Shin, Markus Brunnermeier."
937052461,no,1,It’s actually a surprisingly tight relationship.
937053610,no,1,"For example, unemployment relief financed by loans is more readily accepted than the financing of improvements at a charge below the current rate of interest; whilst the form of digging holes in the ground known as gold-mining, which not only adds nothing whatever to the real wealth of the world but involves the disutility of labour, is the most acceptable of all solutions."
937053568,no,1,Neither the hawks nor the doves (nor anyone else) expected that.
937052619,no,1,That passage has been held up by many people as an example of the wrong-headedness that prevailed at the time.
937052909,no,1,I’m getting the same kind of thing a lot on issues macroeconomic.
937054028,no,1,"But there are a lot of external debts all the same, reflecting private sector borrowing — and foreign currency reserves are dropping fast in part thanks to private capital flight."
937052973,no,1,"Events since then have, as I see it, been a huge vindication for the IS-LM types – despite some headline inflation driven by commodity prices – and a huge failure for the soaring-rates-and-inflation crowd."
937056042,no,0.6625,"And in these assertions, I’d suggest, he goes somewhat astray."
937056413,no,1,"Ignore the numbers, which as best I can tell are all wrong (is this becoming an FT trademark?"
937057367,no,1,But so is Mr. Trump.
937054121,no,1,"But surely the raw observations are consistent with the view that in depressed economies, cutting government spending hurts growth."
937053105,no,1,Keynesian economists made some pretty clear predictions around 3 years ago – predictions that were very much at odds with what anti-Keynesians were saying.
937053830,no,0.6592,"And because they never do the simple version, they don’t realize (or at any rate don’t admit to themselves) how fundamentally silly the whole thing sounds, how much it’s at odds with lived experience."

937057382,no,0.6468,The risks tilt heavility toward inflation rates below official targets.
937052080,no,0.6813,"Update: If this report is true, Ben B. is thinking along similar lines."
937056836,no,1,But standard discourse on macroeconomics has not fully taken the non-deflation surprise into account.
937053293,no,1,But it ain’t so.
937057050,no,1,"And while trade barriers were higher in the 1930s than before, this was partly a response to the Depression, partly a consequence of deflation, which made specific tariffs (i.e., tariffs that are stated in dollars per unit, not as a percentage of value) loom larger."
937056348,no,1,It prevents housing bubbles and stabilizes the financial system!
937053279,no,1,"Lazear’s question is whether a large part of the rise in unemployment is “structural”, that is, reflecting supply factors, or whether it’s mainly simple lack of demand."
937053598,no,1,"The right is purist, uncompromising, and ultimately not interested in contrary evidence; the left is much more open and empirical."
937054710,no,0.6496,"But yesterday’s Steve Rattner article, misuse of labor cost data aside, had me thinking about an issue that has had me annoyed ever since this crisis began: the constant efforts on the part of Very Serious People to turn discussions away from monetary and fiscal policy, recessions and sluggish recoveries, to the supposedly more fundamental issues of structural reform and long-term growth."
937052294,no,1,From various bat squeaks I’ve put together a view of what I think lies behind the surprising — and damaging — deficit squeamishness of the Obama administration.
937053566,no,1,"What Meltzer does, instead, is complain that the Fed has undermined his perfectly fine analysis."
937053850,no,1,"Here you have monetary economists who made a totally wrong prediction, at a time when other people were not only getting it right, but explaining carefully both the theoretical and the empirical basis for their prediction."
937054113,no,1,"How many people, I wonder — even among economists who have eagerly taken sides in the austerity debate — have a sense of what the overall picture looks like since the great turn to austerity in 2010?"
937056389,no,1,We just had another electoral earthquake in the euro area: Podemos-backed candidates have won local elections in Madrid and Barcelona.
937055883,no,1,"I’m not ready to referee this one, at least not yet."
937054053,no,1,"To my own surprise, what the model actually said was that when you’re at the zero lower bound, the size of the current money supply does not matter at all."
937055738,no,1,"Hicks didn’t invent general equilibrium, of course, but he sought to turn it into a useful tool of analysis."
937056993,no,1,"Unfortunately, that underlying Foxification of perceptions marries all too well with the tendency of some — only some — Sanders supporters to assume that any skepticism about their hero’s proposals or prospects must reflect personal corruption."
937052104,no,1,The defective alternator is the financial system.
937056390,no,1,And I hope that the IFKAT — the institutions formerly known as the troika — are paying attention.
937052917,no,1,"Unfortunately, the argument from personal incredulity isn’t restricted to right-wing hacks."
937054047,no,1,And maybe describing my own conversion to monetary pessimism may help clarify what’s happening now.
937054889,no,1,"So Greece is, in effect, only asking that it get to recognize the reality everyone supposedly already understands."
937057132,no,1,"For evidence, look no further than the impact of government borrowing on long-term interest rates in the U.S. during the Great Depression, or more recently, Japan."
937053013,no,1,Yet the creators of the euro essentially threw away hard-won wisdom — stuff that Bagehot knew in the 19th century!
937053952,no,1,"It’s important to understand that we’re not debating about whether Ricardian equivalence is right; even if it were (it isn’t), what the anti-Keynesians were saying was wrong, as I tried to explain a number of times."
937056407,no,1,Evidently the Spanish people don’t agree.
937052884,no,0.6608,"Fiscal policy is “not wholly dependent on expectations changing for its effect (more robust to alternative models of expectations)” That’s about what I was thinking in, say, January 2009."
937056522,no,1,): That tells you everything you need to know about why “internal devaluation” has been such a costly strategy — and why the ECB’s failure to move aggressively early on to achieve and if possible surpass its 2 percent inflation target was a major contributing factor to this disaster.
937053976,no,1,"Instead, reputation comes out of clever papers and snappy seminar presentations."
937056690,no,1,"In the early stages of the Lesser Depression, those of us who knew a bit about the macroeconomic debates of the 1930s, and realized how relevant the hard-won insights of Keynes and Hicks were to the post-financial crisis world, often felt a sense of despair."
937057153,no,0.6389,"Quite a few people — including a lot of people on Wall Street, at the BIS, and so on — look at this and say that it’s terrible: the Fed is keeping interest rates “artificially low” and thereby distorting asset prices across the board, and it will all end in grief."
937055324,no,1,This in turn should mean that the usefulness of deposits is irrelevant in trying to find the true lower bound.
937057103,no,1,What does that even mean?
937052839,no,1,"Specifically, in the past the Sams have borrowed from the Janets to pay for consumption."
937056756,no,1,"It’s awesome to see the ultra-respectable BIS go down this path, and be taken seriously along the way."
937053761,no,0.6345,"Mandel and Barnes, building off work by Goldman Sachs, suggest an ingenious workaround: they use inflation expectations inferred from US TIPS, then adjust by the forward exchange rate."
937054012,no,0.6704,"The big news prior to the plunge was, of course, fracking and all that, which has abruptly reversed the long slide in domestic production: You might think that this surge in production, by reducing imports, has left the US relatively insulated from oil shocks."
937056585,no,0.6741,"The whiteness is, I believe, an important part of the story, as I’ll explain in a minute."
937053359,no,0.6843,"Greg Ip, in correspondence, directs me to Chapter 3 of the latest IMF World Economic Outlook, which among other things contains an analysis of a case that bears directly on the attempts of euro area countries to restore economic health through fiscal austerity and internal devaluation: Britain’s return to the gold standard after World War I."
937056943,no,1,But that’s the point: single-payer just isn’t a political possibility starting from here.
937056609,no,1,This means being continually surprised by the radicalism of the base.
937053132,no,1,What Eurostat gives us are budget balances in euroland as a percentage of GDP.
937053022,no,1,But it’s more than that: these alleged technocrats have in fact systematically ignored both textbook macroeconomics and the lessons of history in favor of fantasies.
937056043,no,1,Let’s first ask whether the possibility of investing abroad obviates the problem of liquidity traps in general (as opposed to secular stagnation.)
937056718,no,0.6797,"But what we should be doing, I now realize, is focusing not on broad classes but on very specific business interests."
937053964,no,1,"Link replaced A new paper by Marion Fourcade, Etienne Ollion, and Yann Algan on the structure of academic economics (pdf) is getting a fair bit of attention among people I talk to."

937053100,no,1,"By the way, there was a second natural experiment with Europe’s move back to fixed rates, and then eventually to the euro."
937052784,no,1,"Anyway, you now know what kind of people we’re dealing with."
937056830,no,0.68,"But I won’t claim that the data prove Hicks/Keynes models right; the point is just that when you do the obvious comparisons, say between austerity and growth, they’re pretty much what a Keynesian would have said: What hasn’t worked nearly as well is our understanding of aggregate supply — which was, if truth be told, always based on much less solid reasoning."
937056589,no,0.6813,"You can point out that they would have done a much better job of investing if they had listened to the MIT gang; sorry, we’re just not their kind of people."
937055467,no,1,But how should we think about this?
937053384,no,1,Sound like anyone you know?
937053981,no,1,I used to refer to the circuit in international economics as the “floating crap game”.
937052134,no,1,"“Full employment” clearly means an unemployment rate near 5 — the CBO says 5.2 for the NAIRU, which seems high to me."
937055180,no,1,But not too much of one.
937057312,no,0.6498,"Moreover, the depressed state of the economy can cripple the process of deleveraging itself, both because debtors don’t have the income to pay down their debts and because falling inflation or deflation increases the real value of debt relative to expectations."
937053255,no,1,"On revenue, it declared: The path for revenues as a percentage of GDP was specified by Chairman Ryan’s staff."
937052171,no,0.7017,Jobs created by stimulus spending are offset by jobs lost from the decline in private spending.

937054141,no,0.6548,"The movement prefers hacks, who needn’t be even minimally competent but can be counted on to defend the party line without any risk of taking an independent stand."
937056681,no,1,"You often find people declaring that it’s only thanks to the special role of the dollar that the United States has been able to run persistent trade deficits — you see, people have to take our money."
937055023,no,1,What’s the state of the Greek crisis?
937052365,no,0.6815,Then I’m probably going to set my price about 5 percent higher than I would if I were only taking current conditions into account.
937055027,no,1,That surplus is believed to be currently running at about 1.5 percent of GDP.
937056581,no,1,"True, there’s no reason to suppose that Paul is deliberately misleading his market – he probably believes his own nonsense."
937056724,no,0.6721,"So the demand for higher rates is coming from a narrow business interest group, not the one percent in general."
937056613,no,1,"But the ur-SHC is John McCain, the Straight-Talking Maverick."
937053693,no,0.6772,"The point is that it’s entirely reasonable to believe that the big factors driving globalization were one-time changes that are receding in the rear-view mirror, so that we should expect the share of trade in GDP to plateau — and that this doesn’t represent any kind of problem."
937053133,no,1,"Kash focuses on the change from 2009 to 2011 as an indicator of austerity, although as he notes, falling GDP means that the true amount of austerity in places like Greece is much bigger than that."
937056293,no,1,And the latest edition is no exception.
937053564,no,1,So it might behoove Meltzer to admit that he was wrong and ask where his analysis went wrong.
937053622,no,1,"I think it’s useful to ask why, as a practical matter, conventional policy-oriented macroeconomists (myself included) used to think we could normally count on a fairly quick return to full employment after a shock — and why we shouldn’t think so anymore."
937052892,no,1,They were: 1.
937053371,no,1,"The IMF has just released a new paper on austerity that is kind of heavy going (unnecessarily, I think), but ends up making a simple but important point."
937053062,no,1,We don’t need the bridge to do that.
937056971,no,1,But I’m used to this stuff.
937057204,no,0.645,"And we have low inflation with high unemployment, strongly suggesting that the natural rate of interest is below current levels, and that the key problem is the zero lower bound which keeps us from getting there."
937055462,no,1,"But for me, at least, the technology helps a lot, not because of the information, exactly, but because it makes self-deception harder."
937053471,no,1,"Because if it works, how will we get structural reform?"
937053878,no,1,"For those wondering what I’m talking about: in the 1970s rational-expectations macroeconomists, led above all by Chicago’s Robert Lucas, made an extremely influential case against any kind of activist policy."
937054023,no,1,"Obviously Russia’s problems stem from other things besides the oil price, namely Ukraine and the fallout thereof."
937052542,no,1,"Oh, and one more thing: are there no copy editors at the FT?"
937053509,no,1,Brad Delong recalls to us Alan Greenspan’s lamentable 2010 op-ed on US debt and deficits.
937054893,no,0.6704,"But as I said, the dynamic is very different this time."
937053021,no,1,"His point is that we’ve conjured up images of very sensible highly educated wonky people doing the right thing, even as they destroy the world."
937052573,no,1,Households borrowed too much; now you want the government to borrow even more?
937053925,no,1,"And of course for those who do get their news from Fox, well, they know, just know, that Obamacare has reduced the number of Americans with insurance and caused premiums to double or something, even though even their favorite news source isn’t saying such things."
937053353,no,0.7138,"Let’s look at a sample of more or less orthodox sticky-price open-economy macro — in this case, Menzie Chinn’s lecture notes (pdf)."
937053267,no,0.6615,"The really strange thing about all this is that this turn toward hard-money mysticism is taking place even as events have demonstrated that the advantages of not being on a gold standard, of having a fiat currency that can be printed freely in emergencies, are even greater than standard analysis had supposed."
937052812,no,1,There are other things the Fed can do; they would help; uncertainty about how much they would help shouldn’t be a reason not to try.
937057245,no,0.666,Brad DeLong is bemused by the way Tyler Cowen makes very heavy going of the simple concept of the natural rate of interest.
937056845,no,1,Ted Cruz somewhat surprised Janet Yellen by accusing the Fed of causing the Great Recession by tightening monetary policy in 2008; David Beckworth sort-of-kind-of supports Cruz by arguing that the Fed did in fact “passively” tighten by failing to do enough to offset falling spending.
937054429,no,1,Most discussion is framed in terms of what happens to the debt.
937053319,no,1,What you really have to wonder about is all the not-stupid economists who have aligned themselves with this guy and that crew.
937056538,no,1,"In other words, that big decline from 2001 to 2002 is mainly telling us about the effects of the pre-devaluation panic, not the effects of devaluation itself."
937053760,no,1,"In particular, the Japanese market in inflation-protected securities is considered too thin to rely on."
937055318,no,1,"But you need to think about the incentives for holding a dollar in one form or the other at the margin, and I think that changes the story."
937054895,no,1,"No matter how bleak the outlook, this is your dominant strategy."
937054462,no,0.7091,"From the point of the Greeks, however, it’s crucial; the difference between a primary surplus of 4.5 percent of GDP and, say, 1.5 percent of GDP for the Greek economy and the welfare of its citizens is huge."
937056894,no,0.6591,By this I mean the attempt to change the subject away from unemployment and inadequate demand toward supposedly more fundamental issues of education and structural reform.
937052833,no,1,"It follows that the level of debt matters only if the distribution of net worth matters, if highly indebted players face different constraints from players with low debt."
937055748,no,1,What does this have to do with macroeconomics?
937053489,no,1,"I didn’t want to mix this in with my substantive Portugal post, but a few readers might be interested in some maudlin memories from my youth."
937053301,no,1,I guess readers didn’t get the reference in my last post.
937057310,no,1,— is not at all the correct implication to draw from a balance-sheet view.
937052972,no,0.6652,"That’s why in early 2009, when the WSJ, the Austrians, and the other usual suspects were screaming about soaring rates and runaway inflation, those who understood IS-LM were predicting that interest rates would stay low and that even a tripling of the monetary base would not be inflationary."
937056239,no,1,"And this makes sense: the case for secular stagnation in Europe is considerably stronger than it is for the U.S.. Working-age population is declining, Japan-style; the euro system, with a shared currency but no fiscal integration, arguably imparts a strong contractionary bias to fiscal policy; and core inflation is already down to just 0.6 percent."

937056542,no,1,"One of the ideas floating around in the aftermath of the sack of Athens has been that of, in effect, deposing Syriza from outside and installing a “technocratic” government."
937052795,no,1,The flow – the rate of purchases – matters only to the extent that it affects expected returns.
937056938,no,0.708,"But to get costs down to, say, Canadian levels, we’d need to do what they do: say no to patients, telling them that they can’t always have the treatment they want."
937057182,no,1,So if you believe that the Fed has been keeping rates artificially low for years on end — which is apparently what Everyone believes — where’s my overheated economy?
937052257,no,0.6914,"But the fact remains that our current problem is, in effect, a problem of excess worldwide savings, looking for someplace to go."
937052561,no,1,Who said this?
937053504,no,1,I sometimes encounter Europeans who think my harsh criticism of the troika and its policies means that I’m anti-European.
937053266,no,0.65,And the GOP platform will reportedly include a call for steps toward a return to the gold standard.
937052699,no,0.6553,"Second, because Spanish debt is in euros, scenario A implies a significantly worse debt burden."
937053915,no,1,But there’s something I’ve noticed from the combination of reactions to what I write and researching past coverage of Obamacare.

937052716,no,1,"Here’s the S&P 500 versus the 10-year TIPS spread, the difference between 10-year interest rates on ordinary government bonds and inflation-protected bonds: That’s pretty clear: since some time in 2008 the correlation has been awesomely close."
937052736,no,1,"If you work with international data, the evidence for price stickiness is so overwhelming that it’s hard to stay in denial."
937052948,no,1,Not necessarily.
937053787,no,0.6733,"But Rudi Dornbusch brought something extra: he showed how to bring rational expectations, at least as a hypothesis, into the sticky-price paradigm, and showed that you could do interesting, fun stuff with the combination."
937054068,no,0.6519,"And now we have the post-2008 experience, and it’s certainly not an example of central banks easily dealing with economic downdrafts."
937052807,no,1,"Greece isn’t going to the market at all these days, since it’s getting all its funding from the bailout package."
937052069,no,1,"Formally, that’s true."
937054748,no,1,So how do we think about this?
937055175,no,1,"Well, that’s the kind of question that should be handled by a professional historian of thought, or at least someone with the time and inclination to go through a lot of records, do interviews, and so on."
937053645,no,1,"First is the zero lower bound on the interest rate: after a sufficiently large shock, the Taylor rule may say that you should keep cutting rates, but you can’t."
937055898,no,1,What a great experience.
937052193,no,0.6592,"I’m tempted to go on and say something about being overrun by barbarians in the grip of an obscurantist faith, but I guess I won’t."
937057054,no,1,There was a big logical problem with that story: How can the Fed do that without causing inflation?
937053071,no,1,"And then taxing them later isn’t going to help, we know that."
937053057,no,1,"There have been a lot of shockingly bad performances among macroeconomists in this crisis; but if I had to pick the one that is most startling, it is the way freshwater economists have demonstrated that they don’t understand one of their own doctrines, that of Ricardian equivalence."
937052674,no,1,Not quite.
937057360,no,0.6621,"Yes, and it also increases employment in industries that compete with imports."
937053587,no,1,But never mind the personal aspect.
937056964,no,0.6609,"And look: if the political theory behind supporting Sanders is that the American people will vote for radical change if you’re honest about what’s involved, the campaign’s evident unwillingness to fully confront the issues, its reliance on magic asterisks, very much weakens that claim."
937055901,no,1,"The same factor plays a major role in explaining differential US regional growth, and thereby hangs a tale."
937054729,no,1,"And since they are also important issues, pretending that they aren’t is a form of moral cowardice."
937055150,no,1,"But there’s another aspect of the story, which is Moore himself: this is a guy who has a troubled relationship with facts."
937053135,no,1,I calculate the amount the budget balance “should” have changed as 0.45*(growth from 2009 to 2011 – 4).
937052377,no,1,But are they the whole story?

937055761,no,1,"In particular, a lot of what you hear about macro issues is monocausal: money drives the price level, borrowing drives interest rates."
937052399,no,1,"Here’s what net borrowing by the US private and public sectors looks like in the Fed’s flow of funds report: The US private sector has gone from being a huge net borrower to being a net lender; meanwhile, government borrowing has surged, but not enough to offset the private plunge."
937054122,no,1,"Of course, the fit isn’t perfect."
937056490,no,1,"In truth, this has never been a fiscal crisis at its root; it has always been a balance of payments crisis that manifests itself in part in budget problems, which have then been pushed onto the center of the stage by ideology."

937056772,no,1,"No, the Fed isn’t imposing a price ceiling on interest rates, he says; in fact, the zero lower bound is acting like a price floor."
937057311,no,1,"On the contrary, what balance-sheet models tell us is that left to itself, the process of deleveraging produces huge, unnecessary costs: debtors are forced to cut back, but creditors have no comparable incentive to spend more, so there is a persistent shortfall of demand that leads to great pain and waste."

937052302,no,1,What’s wrong with this picture?
937053677,no,1,"You can make arguments that suggest bigger gains, but they’re highly speculative, and the credulity with which people accept dubious nonstandard arguments for big trade gains contrasts oddly with the gimlet eye cast on arguments for, say, industrial policy."
937056159,no,1,But I immediately ran up against a big real-world counterexample: Japan.
937052854,no,0.6885,But what if inflation can’t or won’t be delivered?
937054008,no,1,I guess I hope that these things are outliers.
937055174,no,1,So how did MIT establish this unique position in academic economics applied to policy?
937057134,no,0.6708,Or maybe it is.
937056583,no,1,So who are the people who feel a deep affinity with a crotchety crank?
937054292,no,1,And the divide seems to depend on one thing: whether the economist in question is currently in a policy position.
937053687,no,1,"In fact, one reason trade fluctuates so much in the short run is precisely because it’s dominated by manufactured goods."

937057251,no,1,"Anyway, what we need here isn’t a priori arguments or discussions of intellectual history, except insofar as they inform the question at hand: is there any reasonable case that interest rates are being kept “artificially” low given the macroeconomic realities?"

937052477,no,1,"But when you have bought so much debt and created so much money that rates are near zero, the public is saturated with liquidity; from that point on, they’re holding money simply as a store of value, which makes it no different from bonds — and hence a perfect substitute for bonds."

937057335,no,0.6538,But you may differ.
937053637,no,1,"I think it’s useful to ask why, as a practical matter, conventional policy-oriented macroeconomists (myself included) used to think we could normally count on a fairly quick return to full employment after a shock — and why we shouldn’t think so anymore."

937053712,no,1,"By the way, for those critical of globalization, let me hasten to concede that by its nature the Eaton-Kortum model doesn’t let us talk about income distribution, and it also makes no room for the possible role of globalization in causing secular stagnation."

937052876,no,1,"Well, at the Keynes conference this morning Mike Woodford gave an overview of policy options when you’re up against the zero lower bound that in some ways expressed better than I’ve managed to what I was thinking at the time."
937057145,no,1,"But what this must reflect is what people are hearing on the financial news; I’m pretty sure that a lot of people think that all the experts regard interest rates as “artificially low”, and have no idea that to the extent that such a notion makes any sense at all — which is to say in terms of the Wicksellian natural rate — interest rates are too high, not too low."
937053816,no,1,Don’t get me wrong: I like mathematical modeling.

937052751,no,1,Is there anybody out there?
937052441,no,1,But why does this pass for judicious policy discussion?

937056686,no,0.6519,"What you’re left with, basically, is seigniorage: the fact that some people outside your country hold your currency, which means that in effect America gets a zero-interest loan corresponding to the stash of dollar bills — or, mainly $100 bills — held in the hoards of tax evaders, drug dealers, and other friends around the world."
937053302,no,1,"“Charlatans and cranks” was a phrase Greg Mankiw used in the first edition — but only the first edition — of his textbook to describe some of the economic advisers to Ronald Reagan, who told him that broad-based income tax cuts would have such large supply-side effects that the tax cuts would raise tax revenue."

937053669,no,0.695,"But Dean is right to say that trade deficits are an important part of the story — and this is, by the way, something I’ve been saying for quite a while."
937053784,no,1,It’s very hard to tell a story about why it should move the way it does without invoking some kind of price stickiness.
937056164,no,1,"Instead, what happened was that persistent deflation in Japan, combined with the zero lower bound, kept the actual real interest rate well above the Wicksellian rate."

937052943,no,1,"Because we are at minimum talking about *two* variables, not one – GDP as well as the interest rate."
937057147,no,1,What Irwin points out is that the price of just about every asset category is now high by historical standards.

937053420,no,1,2

937055873,no,1,"Mainly that’s because the Very Serious People are too serious to play around with little models; they prefer to rely on their sense of what markets demand, which they continue to consider infallible despite having been wrong about everything."
937056985,no,1,This is not reporting; just a personal reaction.

937052418,no,1,Same as it ever was.
937053639,no,0.6914,Romer described his approach as a way to teach macro — real men were supposed to use fully specified intertemporal optimizing models with a cherry on top — but I think it’s actually the way most practical macro people actually thought and to some extent still think.

937055878,no,1,"Others, for what looks like political reasons, seemed determined to come up with some reason, any reason, to be against expansionary monetary and fiscal policy."
937056910,no,1,"I’ve seen nothing suggesting that fiscal policy has lost traction, and have no idea why Taylor thinks that."
937055464,no,1,"Actually, it’s good news for Europe."
937056701,no,0.7124,"So loanable funds doesn’t determine the interest rate; all it does is define a relationship between interest rates and income, the IS curve of the IS-LM model: What determines where we end up on that curve?"

937056708,no,1,"The worrying thing is that, as I’ve suggested, crude misunderstandings along these lines are widespread even among people who imagine themselves well-informed and sophisticated."
937054867,no,1,Next step: look at the abnormal times we currently live in.
937056937,no,0.6531,And some of that could be replicated via lower administrative costs and the generally lower prices Medicare pays.

937056631,no,1,"Faced with a shock to nominal demand, producers couldn’t tell how much was just a money fluctuation and how much a real change in demand for their particular product, to which they should respond by changing output."
937053990,no,1,"And reading Fourcade et al, it occurs to me that the way everything outside macro works may explain one of the things that has puzzled me in the disputes over macro policy — namely, the seemingly unquenchable certainty among some of the freshwater guys that Keynesians are stupid."
937054149,no,1,I’d say Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer.
937055613,no,1,So why do some parties want this deal so much?
937053031,no,1,"I’ve written quite a lot about the way much of the macroeconomics community has descended into a Dark Age, forgetting the things they used to know."

937057094,no,1,"Bloomberg has a clever chart, showing just how many traders have never seen an economy not at the zero lower bound: This cries out, of course, for a callback to my favorite blog comment ever, on Kevin O’Rourke’s What Do Markets Want?"
937053127,no,1,"Because hey, it’s not as if there has been a rise in saving and a fall in investment demand that might be causing low interest rates: Actually, the only “artificial” thing here is that rates haven’t fallen further, thanks to the zero lower bound on short-term rates."
937057352,no,1,"But wait, it gets better: at the time, Mr. Romney was saying almost exactly the same things Mr. Trump is saying now. "

937054136,no,1,"As Noah Smith says, it was not always thus."
937053017,no,1,"The result of all this is that the supposedly sober, serious people are actually radicals insisting that we can make the economy work in ways that it has never worked in the past — hence the embrace of magical thinking on expansionary austerity and the power of structural reform."

937053043,no,1,During that time instead of everyone working harder because they’re poorer and more indebted than they realized and need to raise their incomes what happens is that 10-20 percent of the population does nothing because they can’t find jobs.
937054743,no,1,"This is a very big problem, but it’s not about generalized excess consumption."
937056928,no,1,"Given all that, the fact that the private sector has added more than twice as many jobs under that job-killing Obama as it did under pre-crisis Bush is important, not because Obama did it, but because it shows that there is no hint that the important things he did do had any negative effect at all, let alone the terrible effects right-wingers predicted."

937053805,no,1,Notice that this isn’t the evil Krugman talking; it’s the respectable Rogoff.
937053243,no,1,But when did the notes become dominant over coin?
937056033,no,1,So I think I may have something useful to add here.
937054135,no,0.6555,"But I think I might have something useful to say about a fact that is really unmistakable when you look at a list corrected by removing central bankers, or make a more subjective judgment: these days, the economist as public intellectual is overwhelmingly likely to be a liberal."

937056383,no,0.6914,"There’s the Romer-Romer narrative approach, which examines Fed minutes to identify “episodes in which there were large monetary disturbances not caused by output fluctuations”, and the Sims approach, which uses time-series methods."
937053103,no,1,I suspect that evidence like this is one reason international macroeconomists have been less likely than domestic macro types to march off into the dreamworld of real business cycles and all that.

937053095,no,1,"Mussa had a simple but powerful insight: if prices were flexible, then all relative prices should be determined by “real” factors, and their behavior shouldn’t change if, say, a country goes from a fixed exchange rate to a flexible rate or vice versa."

937055022,no,1,"Also, did I mention that Jeb Bush seems to be getting his economic ideas from his brother’s 4% growth project, which is led by inflation truther Amity Shlaes?"
937053052,no,1,And international macroeconomists know that the behavior of real exchange rates — exchange rates adjusted for relative inflation — is a prime piece of evidence for price stickiness.
937052145,no,1,The figure above summarizes the key result.
937053138,no,1,So this is a kind of Cary Brown computation.

937052595,no,1,What can be done?
937052337,no,1,I notice that commenters keep citing this paper by Alesina and Ardagna as if it were a definitive rejection of Keynesian economics.
937052188,no,1,"The answer, I think, is that we’re living in a Dark Age of macroeconomics."

937052567,no,0.6644,I believe this present labor supply of ours is peculiarly unadaptable and untrained.
937057156,no,1,"Well, we do know from Wicksell what an unnatural rate, which sounds like more or less the same thing, would be: it would be an interest rate set too low in the sense that the economy overheats and we have accelerating inflation."

937057007,no,1,There was so much wrong with Mitt Romney’s Trump-is-a-disaster-whom-I-will-support-in-the-general speech that it may seem odd to call him out for bad international macroeconomics.
937052759,no,1,Why?
937053948,no,0.6572,"Here they are: First, there’s the Say’s Law argument: because spending must equal income, any increase in government spending must be matched by a fall in private spending."
937054138,no,1,"I’d also argue that the descent of right-leaning macroeconomics into hermetic absurdity matters quite a lot, because macro looms larger in the public sphere than it does within the academy."
937052756,no,1,"Back in the old days, when dinosaurs roamed the earth and students still learned Keynesian economics, we used to hear a lot about the monetary “transmission mechanism” — how the Fed actually got traction on the real economy."

937056786,no,1,"Remember, during the 1930s people like Hayek were liquidationists, with Hayek specifically denouncing expansionary monetary policy during a slump as “the creation of artificial demand.” The era of Friedmanism, of free-market views paired with tolerance for monetary stimulus, was a temporary and unsustainable interlude, and no amount of sensible argumentation will bring it back."

937054126,no,1,"Government spending only explains part of the variation in growth, but the t-statistic is 7.7; for the uninitiated, anything over around 2 is statistically significant at the 95 percent level."
937053781,no,1,For even a cursory look at international data makes a compelling case for short-run price stickiness.
937052906,no,1,"Somewhere in his writings Richard Dawkins talks about anti-evolution types who argue from personal incredulity — they say, “I just can’t believe that chance could create something as complex as an eye”, and think that they have scored an important point."

937053048,no,1,"Alas, yes."
937052443,no,0.6634,"An economy that produced a decent standard of living for its people was in effect hijacked by a combination of free-market ideology and crony capitalism; one of the papers (pdf) at the conference I just attended in Luxembourg shows that the benefits of the financial bubble went overwhelmingly to a small minority at the top of the income distribution: And in the process of building short-lived financial empires, a handful of operators built up enormous debts that their fellow citizens are now expected to repay."
937053855,no,0.6552,"In fact, Marty’s new column is almost identical in its argument to what he wrote in April 2009: he warns that the Fed won’t pull back the liquidity it created when the economy recovers, and inflation will soar."
937055874,no,1,But it also didn’t help that so many economists also rejected what should have been obvious.
937057313,no,1,"So the balance-sheet view actually makes a compelling case for activism — for fiscal deficits to support demand while the private sector gets its balance sheets in order, for monetary policy to support the fiscal policy, for a rise in inflation targets both to encourage whoever isn’t debt-constrained to spend more and to erode the real value of the debt."
937056696,no,1,"Essentially, the clever Q.E."
937052837,no,1,"If you’d grown up in my place and time, you’d know the answer: Sam and Janet evening / You will see a stranger … But actually, I’m thinking of the two kinds of agent in the Kiyotaki-Moore model.)"
937054582,no,0.6538,And if Greece really does leave the euro — if it turns out that the single currency is not irreversible — do you really think there would be no contagion?
937052212,no,1,It’s one thing to have an argument about whether consumers are perfectly rational and have perfect access to the capital markets; it’s another to have the big advocates of all that perfection not understand the implications of their own model.
937056578,no,1,"Of course, we know why: it’s the Bernie Madoff effect, a.k.a."
937056327,no,1,"If they didn’t — if they did not have, at the core of their being, a frightening level of intellectual arrogance — they would never have had the temerity to decide that they had insights denied to all the extremely clever scholars who preceded them."
937054600,no,1,"Look, all major advanced countries have positive inflation targets, generally 2 percent — whether that target is appropriate isn’t something we need to discuss here."
937056577,no,1,So why would anyone pay money for this guy’s analysis?
937056319,no,1,"Last year was the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty, and the date provoked a flurry of studies correcting some widespread myths; perhaps most notable was an enlightening report from the Council of Economic Advisers."
937054011,no,1,And it does seem to me that there’s a bit more to the story than a casual pass might suggest.
937052652,no,1,"If you read what right-wingers say about the economy — and even alleged moderate conservatives, like Tim Pawlenty — you see, over and over again, the assertion that under Obama, government employment has risen sharply even as private employment has fallen."
937054101,no,1,"Not very, he says."
937053888,no,1,"If you like, the 70s showed the limits of policy, but the 80s showed that there were limits to those limits — that monetary policy (and fiscal policy, under some conditions) remained powerful as a tool to stabilize the economy."
937052825,no,0.6575,"There’s a more formal treatment of the ideas, plus a bunch of further results, in my work with Gauti Eggertsson."

937053197,no,0.6843,"Everywhere you turn there are anomalies that should have had that side of the profession questioning its premises, from the absence of the technology shocks that were supposed to drive business cycles, to the evident effectiveness of monetary policy, to the near-perfect correlation of nominal and real exchange rates."
937056629,no,1,"But they insisted that it was illegitimate to assume sticky prices and wages, that any story you tell must be grounded in microfoundations — and not just that, in maximizing behavior."
937057304,no,1,"But the BIS has also gone in heavily for the notion that we’re suffering from a balance-sheet recession, that is, that over-indebtedness on the part of part of the private sector is exerting a persistent drag on the economy."
937056637,no,1,"By the early 1980s, however, it was overwhelmingly clear that rational confusion couldn’t explain business cycles, either empirically or theoretically — business cycles last too long, rational agents should be able to tell real from nominal shocks using information like asset prices, and more."
937056313,no,1,"This says that the deficits were crowding investment in, not out."
937053879,no,1,"The key proposition in that case was an assertion, based on Lucas-type models, that only unanticipated changes in monetary policy had real effects."
937052821,no,1,"As far as I can see, the modest fall in the dollar has been entirely good news for the US economy."

937053178,no,0.6473,"A Very Serious, chin-stroking pundit argues that what we really need is a political leader willing to concede that while the economy needs short-run stimulus, we also need to address long-term deficits, and that addressing those long-term deficits will require both spending cuts and revenue increases."

937053956,no,1,"The money supply argument doesn’t work when we’re at the zero lower bound, which is after all why we’re talking about fiscal policy in the first place; but there is a school of thought that insists that the Fed and the ECB and the BoJ could achieve full employment if only they wanted to."

937053511,no,1,"Nor, I guess, is it notable that, to all appearances, he has learned nothing at all from his predictive failures — that the fact that he was wrong about everything, while the Keynesians got almost everything right, has made no dent in his faith that he has The Truth."
937057408,no,1,"Consider, for example, the case of Denmark, which Bernie Sanders famously held up as a role model."
937055449,no,1,But it’s worth remembering that not all prominent Republicans were predicting 70s-style stagflation; some of them were predicting Weimar-style hyperinflation instead.
937052717,no,1,"That said, my second complaint: that big drop in the TIPS spread in 2008-2009 wasn’t entirely about inflation expectations."
937054744,no,1,And the problems with public debt are also mainly about possible instability rather than “borrowing from our children”.

937053999,no,1,"They haven’t heard about these New Keynesian guys or their papers, so there must be nothing there — which is something you can get away with in trade, but not in macro amid a global crisis."
937052811,no,0.693,"Here’s what I actually said about QE2: I believe that given the grim economic situation, all players in the game should be trying to do whatever they can."
937056437,no,0.6405,"Traditional IS-LM analysis said that the Fed’s policies would have little effect on inflation; so did the translation of that analysis into a stripped-down New Keynesian framework that I did back in 1998, starting the modern liquidity-trap literature."
937057044,no,0.6615,But that’s not at all the same as saying that it causes recessions.
937053777,no,1,"What’s interesting, as Appelbaum notes, is that the revival of Keynesian ideas was taking place at a time when Chicago was proclaiming Keynes gone, vanquished, consigned to the dustbin of history, pushing up the daisies, joined the choir invisible (hand invisible?)."
937056712,no,1,"And that, I think, tells us what we need to know about the political economy of permahawkery."
937055031,no,0.6787,Much like the reparations the Allies tried to extract from Germany after World War I — although for somewhat different reasons — forcing Greece to run huge primary surpluses at this point would impose a very large “excess burden” over and above the direct cost of the surpluses themselves.
937055889,no,1,And then there is the unprecedented fiscal austerity.
937056704,no,0.6718,And how would you know if the Fed is setting rates too low?
937052670,no,1,"What happens when you’re in a liquidity trap, with short-term interest rates up against the zero lower bound?"
937053908,no,1,Hahahaha.
937053214,no,1,"As it happens, the best nonpartisan analysis, in my judgment, is the CBO report on the first vintage (pdf); as I said, details change, but the general idea remains the same."
937056768,no,1,The biggest piece of the super-rich-super-donor story is money from the financial sector.
937053849,no,1,What gets me here is the complete unwillingness to accept the reality test.
937052998,no,1,"Ah, remember when right-leaning economists were mocking the Euroskeptics, including yours truly?"
937053210,no,1,But so it goes.

937054886,no,1,What Greece is asking for — although German voters probably don’t know this — is not a fresh infusion of money.
937053519,no,1,"One of them was that in a way, China’s low-consumption high-investment economy was a kind of Ponzi scheme."
937057062,no,1,And it’s therefore the rate monetary policy is supposed to achieve.
937053991,no,1,"Again and again we’ve seen freshwater macroeconomists declare that New Keynesians, let alone those who respect the older stuff, don’t get some basic point; they don’t understand the accounting identities, they don’t understand Ricardian equivalence, they don’t understand the Euler condition, they don’t understand the Fisher equation."
937056287,no,0.6545,An aging population and the demand for a more highly educated work force certainly push in that direction.
937055881,no,1,The basic model works; we really do know what we’re talking about.
937052068,no,1,I still keep reading articles asserting that the last two recessions were brief and shallow.
937053179,no,1,And then the pundit asserts that both parties are to blame for the absence of such leaders.
937053024,no,0.6538,"Meanwhile, the European policy elite has simply wished away the clear evidence that the euro zone needs to make an adjustment that is virtually impossible unless inflation targets are raised."
937053502,no,1,"But this normality was, as we all recognized, a wonderful thing: Portugal had emerged from a long, troubled history to become part of the basic decency of the European social model."
937052107,no,1,"The latest Case-Shiller housing price numbers are out, and they’re as grim as you might expect."
937056688,no,1,"The point is that while reserve-currency status may have political symbolism attached, it’s essentially irrelevant as an economic goal — and definitely not worth distorting policy to achieve."
937057074,no,0.6612,"Finally, if the natural real rate is zero or less, a 2 percent inflation target gives very little room for interest rate cuts to fight recessions."
937057225,no,0.6825,"Remember, it was Bush, not a Democrat, who imposed a WTO-illegal steel tariff, then had to back down in the face of European pressure."
937053608,no,1,"As I’ve explained before, the alien thing was a modern riff on Keynes’s coalmine thought experiment."
937056989,no,1,"And some people really want to hear that message, and don’t want to hear that they’re being unrealistic."
937053204,no,1,"But we also need better critics, who are prepared to take the risk of actually taking sides for good economics and against dogmatism."
937052752,no,1,Apparently not — at least not at the World Bank.
937057211,no,1,"Think of all the people living on fixed incomes, we’re told."
937056249,no,1,"So on the policy debate, I come down firmly on the Summers side."
937054112,no,1,Let me jump right in here.
937052444,no,1,But there’s an odd coda to the story.
937054461,no,1,"From the point of view of the creditors, that’s a trivial sum."
937053390,no,1,Some readers have asked me to reply to this Steve Keen piece claiming that I don’t understand the IS-LM model.
937053180,no,1,"What he absolutely won’t do is endanger his centrist credentials by admitting that the position he’s just outlined is exactly, exactly, the position of Barack Obama."
937052324,no,0.6524,What the worriers seem to regard as a danger sign — that supposedly awful carry trade — is exactly what you would expect to see even if fiscal policy were on a perfectly sustainable trajectory.
937052238,no,1,"Now, we usually explain how this curve is derived in a different way: we say that given the interest rate, you can determine investment demand, and then through the multiplier process this determines GDP."
937052720,no,1,"The correlation in 2009-10 is the real deal, however."
937055591,no,1,"So, about the deal."
937053597,no,1,And left and right in modern America are not mirror images.
937053063,no,1,We can print up the same amount of money and buy anything with it.
937056638,no,1,"And so you had a substantial chunk of the profession going back to sticky-price models, arguing that under imperfect competition things like menu costs or slight deviations from perfect rationality were enough to make money very non-neutral in the short run."
937053191,no,1,And there’s a widespread acceptance that we were paying too little attention to debt and the financial sector.
937053342,no,1,"In effect, the policy is to inflict pain for the sake of inflicting pain."
937057299,no,1,"And it therefore claimed that easy money would lead to a rapid rise in inflation, despite the high level of unemployment."
937053661,no,0.643,"After around 2000, you could argue that policies abroad were responsible: China and other developing countries were clearly keeping their currencies undervalued and accumulating large dollar reserves, and the counterpart of that accumulation had to be deficits in the rest of the world, which ended up meaning us."
937056448,no,1,But it would be wrong.
937055030,no,1,"Given the macroeconomics, however, it is much bigger than it looks."
937056824,no,1,And you would not have found anything in what happened from 2008 on that contradicted your views.
937055730,no,1,"Well, as a card-carrying economist I disavow any responsibility for Rick Santelli and Larry Kudlow; I similarly declare that Paul Ryan and Olli Rehn aren’t my fault."
937056608,no,1,"On the other side, they have had to invent an imaginary GOP that bears little resemblance to the real thing."
937056331,no,1,Which brings me to the case of John Taylor.
937056710,no,1,Awesome.
937053742,no,1,I eagerly await a response.
937056275,no,1,"You can make the case that there are some aspects of education that are a public good, but that’s not really why we rely on the government to provide most education, and not at all why the government is so involved in retirement and health."
937056666,no,1,China has now demonstrated that its currency peg is no longer solid; but it has come nowhere near to devaluing enough to create expectations of future appreciation.

937053614,no,1,Leave macroeconomics on one side: what about the theory of the second best?
937057276,no,0.6596,So why is this supposed to be something to worry about?
937053689,no,1,My view is that rapid trade growth since World War II was driven by two great waves of trade liberalization and one major technological innovation.
937052802,no,1,"I’d also add that if flows matter a lot — if it’s hard to persuade investors to buy a suddenly increased quantity of newly issued Treasuries per month, as opposed to being willing to hold the total amount of Treasuries outstanding — the big shift into budget deficits and the corresponding increase in Treasury issuance should have led to sharply rising interest rates."
937053225,no,0.6576,"Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center calls these unspecified sources of revenue “mystery meat”, and strongly suggests that nothing like this would actually happen."
937053324,no,1,"The basic story of the euro crisis remains the same: it’s essentially a balance of payments crisis, misinterpreted as a fiscal crisis, and the key question is whether internal devaluation is really workable."
937056527,no,0.7027,What Carmen Reinhart tells us is that we should expect very bad things.
937053154,no,1,"So as I read it, between falling tax payments without any corresponding fall in federal benefits, plus safety-net aid — not counting Medicaid, which would make the number even bigger — Florida received what amounted to an annual transfer from Washington of $31 billion plus, or more than 4 percent of state GDP."
937056563,no,1,"Each point in the scatterplot represents an individual GIIPS country in a given year, with the horizontal axis showing the change in the structural balance — effectively, the additional austerity imposed in that year — and the vertical axis representing the rate of growth."
937054859,no,1,"What happens if there is an increase in demand, say because household balance sheets have improved?"
937053028,no,1,"But the real technocrats — people like Christy Romer and, well, me — were saying right from the beginning that the stimulus was too small, etc."

937053514,no,0.7091,"With notably rare exceptions (2008, for example), the global “invisible hand” has created relatively stable exchange rates, interest rates, prices, and wage rates."
937052484,no,0.6565,"In practice, things are more complicated, because long-term bonds aren’t perfect substitutes for short-term — so the Fed can get some traction by buying at longer maturities."
937055165,no,1,"Of course, I would think that, since that was when I went to school there, and this post is surely self-indulgent."
937053965,no,1,"The tone is rather jaundiced, but that’s surely a defensible attitude, and everything substantive it says about economics rings true from my own experience; I’m glad to see that quantitative analysis confirms what I thought."
937056705,no,0.6592,Here’s where Hicks meets Wicksell: rates are too low if the economy is overheating and inflation is accelerating.
937052768,no,1,"Still, trade does seem to be making a positive contribution."
937055172,no,1,It’s true that the more or less Keynesian view of macroeconomics common to everyone on this list is by no means unchallenged in the real world; but the anti-Keynesians don’t really turn to academic economists for guidance.
937056418,no,1,What’s going on?
937057027,no,1,"And while trade barriers were higher in the 1930s than before, this was partly a response to the Depression, partly a consequence of deflation, which made specific tariffs (i.e., tariffs that are stated in dollars per unit, not as a percentage of value) loom larger."
937056393,no,0.6798,"But now the IMF is playing bad cop, declaring that it cannot release funds until Syriza toes the line on pensions and labor market reform."
937053381,no,1,(My emphasis).
937052889,no,1,"I guess I’d say that if powerful political forces block any effective response to a crisis, there is no effective response to that crisis."
937057143,no,1,"I just answered some questions for Princeton magazine, and among them was this: Please comment on how artificially low interest rates have impacted the current value of baby boomers’ retirement portfolios and should this be a consideration of the Federal Reserve?"
937052779,no,1,Yesterday afternoon I downloaded the tables from that Heritage report that’s the basis for the Ryan plan.
937056817,no,1,Back then it was almost universally insisted that the failure of monetary base expansion to filter through into bank lending showed that a dysfunctional banking system was the core of Japan’s problem.
937053983,no,1,"I may have been exaggerating the extent to which this is true of other disciplines, but economics for sure."
937057264,no,0.6568,"So even if you believe that a low-rate environment is helping to feed a series of bubbles, you have to ask how it can possibly make sense to raise rates when the underlying problem is overall economic weakness, which a rate hike would make worse."
937055162,no,1,So I found it — as Spock would say — fascinating.
937052142,no,0.6547,"And then Mitch McConnell says “See, government spending doesn’t work.” Let’s hope I’ve got this wrong."
937052618,no,1,"There’s a famous passage in Schumpeter’s writings during the Great Depression, in which he lays out the extreme liquidationist position, arguing not just against the use of fiscal policy to fight unemployment but even against monetary policy, lest it get in the way of the “work of depressions”."
937056670,no,0.6619,But this would greatly increase trade tensions and pose problems for foreign policy.
937052750,no,1,Is that explanation clear enough to get through?
937055744,no,1,Choose Z as the numeraire – the good in which prices are measured.
